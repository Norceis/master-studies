',\n '                Appendices I - XII ',\n '                             Preface ',\n 'THIS book is a slice of intensified history\\x97history as I saw it. It ',\n 'does not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the November ',\n 'Revolution, when the Bolsheviki, at the head of the workers and ',\n 'soldiers, seized the state power of Russia and placed it in the hands ',\n 'of the Soviets. ',\n 'Naturally most of it deals with \\x93Red Petrograd,\\x94 the capital and heart ',\n 'of the insurrection. But the reader must realize that what took place ',\n 'in Petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or lesser ',\n 'intensity, at different intervals of time, all over Russia. ',\n 'In this book, the first of several which I am writing, I must confine ',\n 'myself to a chronicle of those events which I myself observed and ',\n 'experienced, and those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by two ',\n 'chapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the November ',\n 'Revolution. I am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading, ',\n 'but they are essential to an understanding of what follows. ',\n 'Many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader. What ',\n 'is Bolshevism? What kind of a governmental structure did the Bolsheviki ',\n 'set up? If the Bolsheviki championed the Constituent Assembly before ',\n 'the November Revolution, why did they disperse it by force of arms ',\n 'afterward? And if the bourgeoisie opposed the Constituent Assembly ',\n 'until the danger of Bolshevism became apparent, why did they champion ',\n 'it afterward? ',\n 'These and many other questions cannot be answered here. In another ',\n 'volume, \\x93Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,\\x94 I trace the course of the ',\n 'Revolution up to and including the German  peace. There I explain the ',\n 'origin and functions of the Revolutionary organisations, the evolution ',\n 'of popular sentiment, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the ',\n 'structure of the Soviet state, and the course and outcome of the Brest- ',\n 'Litovsk negotiations\\x85. ',\n 'In considering the rise of the Bolsheviki it is necessary to understand ',\n 'that Russian economic life and the Russian army were not disorganised ',\n 'on November 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the logical result of ',\n 'a process which began as far back as 1915. The corrupt reactionaries in ',\n 'control of the Tsar\\x92s Court deliberately undertook to wreck Russia in ',\n 'order to make a separate peace with Germany. The lack of arms on the ',\n 'front, which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915, the ',\n 'lack of food in the army and in the great cities, the break-down of ',\n 'manufactures and transportation in 1916\\x97all these we know now were part ',\n 'of a gigantic campaign of sabotage. This was halted just in time by the ',\n 'March Revolution. ',\n 'For the first few months of the new régime, in spite of the confusion ',\n 'incident upon a great Revolution, when one hundred and sixty millions ',\n 'of the world\\x92s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, both ',\n 'the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually ',\n 'improved. ',\n 'But the \\x93honeymoon\\x94 was short. The propertied classes wanted merely a ',\n 'political revolution, which would take the power from the Tsar and give ',\n 'it to them. They wanted Russia to be a constitutional Republic, like ',\n 'France or the United States; or a constitutional Monarchy, like ',\n 'England. On the other hand, the masses of the people wanted real ',\n 'industrial and agrarian democracy. ',\n 'William English Walling, in his book, \\x93Russia\\x92s Message,\\x94 an account of ',\n 'the Revolution of 1905, describes very well the state of mind of the ',\n 'Russian workers, who were later to support Bolshevism almost ',\n 'unanimously: ',\n 'They (the working people) saw it was possible that even under a free ',\n 'Government, if it fell into the hands of other social classes, they ',\n 'might still continue to starve\\x85. ',\n 'The Russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither violent, ',\n 'dogmatic, nor unintelligent. He is ready for barricades, but he has ',\n 'studied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has learned ',\n 'about them from actual experience. He is ready and willing to fight his ',\n 'oppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. But he does not ignore ',\n 'the existence of other classes. He merely asks that the other classes ',\n 'take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near\\x85. ',\n 'They (the workers) were all agreed that our (American) political ',\n 'institutions were preferable to their own, but they were not very ',\n 'anxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the capitalist ',\n 'class)\\x85. ',\n 'The workingmen of Russia did not have themselves shot down, executed by ',\n 'hundreds in Moscow, Riga and Odessa, imprisoned by thousands in every ',\n 'Russian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions, in ',\n 'exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of Goldfields ',\n 'and Cripple Creek\\x85. ',\n 'And so developed in Russia, in the midst of a foreign war, the Social ',\n 'Revolution on top of the Political Revolution, culminating in the ',\n 'triumph of Bolshevism. ',\n 'Mr. A. J. Sack, director in this country of the Russian Information ',\n 'Bureau, which opposes the Soviet Government, has this to say in his ',\n 'book, \\x93The Birth of the Russian Democracy\\x94: The Bolsheviks organised ',\n 'their own cabinet, with Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon Trotsky\\x97 ',\n 'Minister of Foreign Affairs. The inevitability of their coming into ',\n 'power became evident almost immediately after the March Revolution. The ',\n 'history of the Bolsheviki, after the Revolution, is a history of their ',\n 'steady growth\\x85. ',\n 'Foreigners, and Americans especially, frequently emphasise the ',\n '\\x93ignorance\\x94 of the Russian workers. It is true they lacked the ',\n 'political experience of the peoples of the West, but they were very ',\n 'well trained in voluntary organisation. In 1917 there were more than ',\n 'twelve million members of the Russian consumers\\x92 Cooperative societies; ',\n 'and the Soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their ',\n 'organising genius. Moreover, there is probably not a people in the ',\n 'world so well educated in Socialist theory and its practical ',\n 'application. ',\n 'William English Walling thus characterises them: ',\n 'The Russian working people are for the most part able to read and ',\n 'write. For many years the country has been in such a disturbed ',\n 'condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of ',\n 'intelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of the ',\n 'equally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the working ',\n 'people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of ',\n 'Russia\\x85. ',\n 'Many writers explain their hostility to the Soviet Government by ',\n 'arguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was simply a ',\n 'struggle of the \\x93respectable\\x94 elements against the brutal attacks of ',\n 'Bolshevism. However, it was the propertied classes, who, when they ',\n 'realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary ',\n 'organisations, undertook to destroy them and to halt the Revolution. To ',\n 'this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures. ',\n 'In order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and the Soviets, transportation ',\n 'was disorganised and internal troubles provoked; to crush the Factory- ',\n 'Shop Committees, plants were shut down, and fuel and raw materials ',\n 'diverted; to break the Army Committees at the front, capital punishment ',\n 'was restored and military defeat connived at. ',\n 'This was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire. The Bolsheviki ',\n 'retorted by preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy of ',\n 'the Soviets. ',\n 'Between these two extremes, with the other factions which whole- ',\n 'heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the so-called ',\n '\\x93moderate\\x94 Socialists, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, ',\n 'and several smaller parties. These groups were also attacked by the ',\n 'propertied classes, but their power of resistance was crippled by their ',\n 'theories. ',\n 'Roughly, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed that ',\n 'Russia was not economically ripe for a social revolution\\x97that only a ',\n '_political_ revolution was possible. According to their interpretation, ',\n 'the Russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power; any ',\n 'attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means of ',\n 'which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime. And so it ',\n 'followed that when the \\x93moderate\\x94 Socialists were forced to assume the ',\n 'power, they were afraid to use it. ',\n 'They believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political and ',\n 'economic development known to Western Europe, and emerge at last, with ',\n 'the rest of the world, into full-fledged Socialism. Naturally, ',\n 'therefore, they agreed with the propertied classes that Russia must ',\n 'first be a parliamentary state\\x97though with some improvements on the ',\n 'Western democracies. As a consequence, they insisted upon the ',\n 'collaboration of the propertied classes in the Government. ',\n 'From this it was an easy step to supporting them. The \\x93moderate\\x94 ',\n 'Socialists needed the bourgeoisie. But the bourgeoisie did not need the ',\n '\\x93moderate\\x94 Socialists. So it resulted in the Socialist Ministers being ',\n 'obliged to give way, little by little, on their entire program, while ',\n 'the propertied classes grew more and more insistent. ',\n 'And at the end, when the Bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise, ',\n 'the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found themselves fighting ',\n 'on the side of the propertied classes\\x85. In almost every country in the ',\n 'world to-day the same phenomenon is visible. ',\n 'Instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that the ',\n 'Bolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive program ',\n 'and the power to impose it on the country. If they had not succeeded to ',\n 'the Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that the ',\n 'armies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow in ',\n 'December, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar\\x85. ',\n 'It is still fashionable, after a whole year of the Soviet Government, ',\n 'to speak of the Bolshevik insurrection as an \\x93adventure.\\x94 Adventure it ',\n 'was, and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon, ',\n 'sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses, and staking ',\n 'everything on their vast and simple desires. Already the machinery had ',\n 'been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed ',\n 'among the peasants. The Factory-Shop Committees and the Trade Unions ',\n 'were there to put into operation workers\\x92 control of industry. In every ',\n 'village, town, city, district and province there were Soviets of ',\n 'Workers\\x92, Soldiers\\x92 and Peasants\\x92 Deputies, prepared to assume the task ',\n 'of local administration. ',\n 'No matter what one thinks of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that the ',\n 'Russian Revolution is one of the great events of human history, and the ',\n 'rise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon of world-wide importance. Just as ',\n 'historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of ',\n 'the Paris Commune, so they will want to know what happened in Petrograd ',\n 'in November, 1917, the spirit which animated the people, and how the ',\n 'leaders looked, talked and acted. It is with this in view that I have ',\n 'written this book. ',\n 'In the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. But in telling the ',\n 'story of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of a ',\n 'conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth. ',\n '                                        J. R. ',\n '    New York, January 1st 1919. ',\n '                        Notes and Explanations ',\n 'To the average reader the multiplicity of Russian ',\n 'organisations-political groups, Committees and Central Committees, ',\n 'Soviets, Dumas and Unions-will prove extremely confusing. For this ',\n 'reason I am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations. ',\n '                        Political Parties ',\n 'In the elections to the Constituent Assembly, there were seventeen ',\n 'tickets in Petrograd, and in some of the provincial towns as many as ',\n 'forty; but the following summary of the aims and composition of ',\n 'political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in ',\n 'this book. Only the essence of their programmes and the general ',\n 'character of their constituencies can be noticed.... ',\n '  1. _Monarchists,_ of various shades, _Octobrists,_ etc. These ',\n 'once-powerful factions no longer existed openly; they either worked ',\n 'underground, or their members joined the _Cadets,_ as the _Cadets_ ',\n 'came by degrees to stand for their political programme. ',\n 'Representatives in this book, Rodzianko, Shulgin. ',\n '  2. _Cadets._ So-called from the initials of its name, ',\n 'Constitutional Democrats. Its official name is \"Party of the People\\'s ',\n 'Freedom.\" Under the Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertied ',\n 'classes, the _Cadets_ were the great party of _political_ reform, ',\n 'roughly corresponding to the Progressive Party in America. When the ',\n 'Revolution broke out in March, 1917, the _Cadets_ formed the first ',\n 'Provisional Government. The _Cadet_ Ministry was overthrown in April ',\n 'because it declared itself in favour of Allied imperialistic aims, ',\n \"including the imperialistic aims of the Tsar's Government. As the \",\n 'Revolution became more and more a _social economic_ Revolution, the ',\n '_Cadets_ grew more and more conservative. Its representatives in this ',\n 'book are: Miliukov, Vinaver, Shatsky. ',\n '  2a. _Group of Public Men._ After the _Cadets_ had become unpopular ',\n 'through their relations with the Kornilov counter-revolution, the ',\n '_Group of Public Men_ was formed in Moscow. Delegates from the _Group ',\n 'of Public Men_ were given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet. ',\n 'The _Group_ declared itself non-partisan, although its intellectual ',\n 'leaders were men like Rodzianko and Shulgin. It was composed of the ',\n 'more \"modern\" bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who were ',\n 'intelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought by ',\n 'their own weapon-economic organisation. Typical of the _Group:_ ',\n 'Lianozov, Konovalov. ',\n '  3. _Populist Socialists,_ or _Trudoviki_ (Labour Group). ',\n 'Numerically a small party, composed of cautious intellectuals, the ',\n 'leaders of the Cooperative societies, and conservative peasants. ',\n 'Professing to be Socialists, the _Populists_ really supported the ',\n 'interests of the petty bourgeoisie-clerks, shopkeepers, etc. By ',\n 'direct descent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of the ',\n 'Labour Group in the Fourth Imperial Duma, which was composed largely ',\n 'of peasant representatives. Kerensky was the leader of the ',\n '_Trudoviki_ in the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March, 1917, ',\n 'broke out. The _Populist Socialists_ are a nationalistic party. Their ',\n 'representatives in this book are: Peshekhanov, Tchaikovsky. ',\n '  4. _Russian Social Democratic Labour Party._ Originally Marxian ',\n 'Socialists. At a party congress held in 1903, the party split, on the ',\n 'question of tactics, into two factions-the Majority (Bolshinstvo), ',\n 'and the Minority (Menshinstvo). From this sprang the names ',\n '\"Bolsheviki\" and \"Mensheviki\"-\"members of the majority\" and \"members ',\n 'of the minority.\" These two wings became two separate parties, both ',\n 'calling themselves \"Russian Social Democratic Labour Party,\" and both ',\n 'professing to be Marxians. Since the Revolution of 1905 the ',\n 'Bolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again the majority in ',\n 'September, 1917. ',\n '  a. _Mensheviki._ This party includes all shades of Socialists who ',\n 'believe that society must progress by natural evolution toward ',\n 'Socialism, and that the working-class must conquer political power ',\n 'first. Also a nationalistic party. This was the party of the ',\n 'Socialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of education ',\n 'having been in the hands of the propertied classes, the intellectuals ',\n 'instinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of the ',\n 'propertied classes. Among their representatives in this book are: ',\n 'Dan, Lieber, Tseretelli. ',\n '  b. _Mensheviki Internationalists._ The radical wing of the ',\n '_Mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all coalition with the ',\n 'propertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from the ',\n 'conservative Mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of the ',\n 'working-class advocated by the Bolsheviki. Trotzky was long a member ',\n 'of this group. Among their leaders: Martov, Martinov. ',\n '  c. _Bolsheviki._ Now call themselves the _Communist Party,_ in ',\n 'order to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of ',\n '\"moderate\" or \"parliamentary\" Socialism, which dominates the ',\n 'Mensheviki and the so-called Majority Socialists in all countries. ',\n 'The _Bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, and ',\n 'seizure of the reins of Government, in order to hasten the coming of ',\n 'Socialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural resources ',\n 'and financial institutions. This party expresses the desires chiefly ',\n 'of the factory workers, but also of a large section of the poor ',\n 'peasants. The name \"Bolshevik\" can _not_ be translated by ',\n '\"Maximalist.\" The Maximalists are a separate group. (See paragraph ',\n '5b). Among the leaders: Lenin, Trotzky, Lunatcharsky. ',\n '  d. _United Social Democrats Internationalists._ Also called the ',\n '_Novaya Zhizn_ (New Life) group, from the name of the very ',\n 'influential newspaper which was its organ. A little group of ',\n 'intellectuals with a very small following among the working-class, ',\n 'except the personal following of Maxim Gorky, its leader. ',\n 'Intellectuals, with almost the same programme as the _Mensheviki ',\n 'Internationalists,_ except that the _Novaya Zhizn_ group refused to ',\n 'be tied to either of the two great factions. Opposed the Bolshevik ',\n 'tactics, but remained in the Soviet Government. Other representatives ',\n 'in this book: Avilov, Kramarov. ',\n '  e. _Yedinstvo._ A very small and dwindling group, composed almost ',\n 'entirely of the personal following of Plekhanov, one of the pioneers ',\n \"of the Russian Social Democratic movement in the 80's, and its \",\n 'greatest theoretician. Now an old man, Plekhanov was extremely ',\n 'patriotic, too conservative even for the Mensheviki. After the ',\n \"Bolshevik _coup d'etat, Yedinstvo_ disappeared. \",\n '  5. _Socialist Revolutionary party._ Called _Essaires_ from the ',\n 'initials of their name. Originally the revolutionary party of the ',\n 'peasants, the party of the Fighting Organisations-the Terrorists. ',\n 'After the March Revolution, it was joined by many who had never been ',\n 'Socialists. At that time it stood for the abolition of private ',\n 'property in land only, the owners to be compensated in some fashion. ',\n 'Finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the ',\n '_Essaires_ to abandon the \"compensation\" clause, and led to the ',\n 'younger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main party ',\n 'in the fall of 1917 and forming a new party, the _Left Socialist ',\n 'Revolutionary party._ The _Essaires,_ who were afterward always ',\n 'called by the radical groups _\"Right Socialist Revolutionaries,\"_ ',\n 'adopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki, and worked together ',\n 'with them. They finally came to represent the wealthier peasants, the ',\n 'intellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of remote ',\n 'rural districts. Among them there was, however, a wider difference of ',\n 'shades of political and economic opinion than among the Mensheviki. ',\n 'Among their leaders mentioned in these pages: Avksentiev, Gotz, ',\n 'Kerensky, Tchernov, \"Babuschka\" Breshkovskaya. ',\n '  a. _Left Socialist Revolutionaries._ Although theoretically sharing ',\n 'the Bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working-class, at ',\n 'first were reluctant to follow the ruthless Bolshevik tactics. ',\n 'However, the _Left Socialist Revolutionaries_ remained in the Soviet ',\n 'Government, sharing the Cabinet portfolios, especially that of ',\n 'Agriculture. They withdrew from the Government several times, but ',\n 'always returned. As the peasants left the ranks of the _Essaires_ in ',\n 'increasing numbers, they joined the _Left Socialist Revolutionary ',\n 'party,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the Soviet ',\n 'Government, standing for confiscation without compensation of the ',\n 'great landed estates, and their disposition by the peasants ',\n 'themselves. Among the leaders: Spiridonova, Karelin, Kamkov, ',\n 'Kalagayev. ',\n '  b. _Maximalists._ An off-shoot of the _Socialist Revolutionary ',\n 'party_ in the Revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful peasant ',\n 'movement, demanding the immediate application of the maximum ',\n 'Socialist programme. Now an insignificant group of peasant ',\n 'anarchists. ',\n '                        Parliamentary Procedure ',\n 'Russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental ',\n 'model rather than our own. The first action is usually the election ',\n 'of officers and the _presidium._ ',\n '  The _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed of ',\n 'representatives of the groups and political factions represented in ',\n 'the assembly, in proportion to their numbers. The _presidium_ ',\n 'arranges the Order of Business, and its members can be called upon by ',\n 'the President to take the chair _pro tem._ ',\n '  Each question (_vopros_) is stated in a general way and then ',\n 'debated, and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by ',\n 'the different factions, and each one voted on separately. The Order ',\n 'of Business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the first ',\n 'half hour. On the plea of \"emergency,\" which the crowd almost always ',\n 'grants, anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any ',\n 'subject. The crowd controls the meeting, practically the only ',\n 'functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little ',\n 'bell, and to recognise speakers. Almost all the real work of the ',\n 'session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political ',\n 'factions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and are ',\n 'represented by floor-leaders. The result is, however, that at every ',\n 'important new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to enable ',\n 'the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus. ',\n '  The crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling speakers, ',\n 'over-riding the plans of the _presidium._ Among the customary cries ',\n 'are: _\"Prosim!_ Please! Go on!\" _\"Pravilno!\"_ or _\"Eto vierno!_ ',\n 'That\\'s true! Right!\" _\"Do volno!_ Enough!\" _\"Doloi!_ Down with him!\" ',\n '_\"Posor!_ Shame!\" and _\"Teesche!_ Silence! Not so noisy!\" ',\n '                        Popular Organisations ',\n '1. _Soviet._ The word _soviet_ means \"council.\" Under the Tsar the ',\n 'Imperial Council of State was called _Gosudarstvennyi Soviet._ Since ',\n 'the Revolution, however, the term _Soviet_ has come to be associated ',\n 'with a certain type of parliament elected by members of working-class ',\n \"economic organisations-the Soviet of Workers', of Soldiers', or of \",\n \"Peasants' Deputies. I have therefore limited the word to these \",\n 'bodies, and wherever else it occurs I have translated it \"Council.\" ',\n '  Besides the local _Soviets,_ elected in every city, town and ',\n 'village of Russia-and in large cities, also Ward _(Raionny) ',\n 'Soviets_-there are also the _oblastne_ or _gubiernsky_ (district or ',\n 'provincial) _Soviets,_ and the Central Executive Committee of the ',\n 'All-Russian _Soviets_ in the capital, called from its initials ',\n '_Tsay-ee-kah._ (See below, \"Central Committees\"). ',\n \"  Almost everywhere the _Soviets_ of Workers' and of Soldiers' \",\n 'Deputies combined very soon after the March Revolution. In special ',\n \"matters concerning their peculiar interests, however, the Workers' \",\n \"and the Soldiers' Sections continued to meet separately. The \",\n \"_Soviets_ of Peasants' Deputies did not join the other two until \",\n \"after the Bolshevik _coup d'etat._ They, too, were organised like the \",\n 'workers and soldiers, with an Executive Committee of the All-Russian ',\n \"Peasants' _Soviets_ in the capital. \",\n '  2. _Trade Unions._ Although mostly industrial in form, the Russian ',\n 'labour unions were still called Trade Unions, and at the time of the ',\n 'Bolshevik Revolution had from three to four million members. These ',\n 'Unions were also organised in an All-Russian body, a sort of Russian ',\n 'Federation of Labour, which had its Central Executive Committee in ',\n 'the capital. ',\n '  3. _Factory-Shop Committees._ These were spontaneous organisations ',\n 'created in the factories by the workers in their attempt to control ',\n 'industry, taking advantage of the administrative break-down incident ',\n 'upon the Revolution. Their function was by revolutionary action to ',\n 'take over and run the factories. The _Factory-Shop Committees_ also ',\n 'had their All-Russian organisation, with a Central Committee at ',\n 'Petrograd, which co-operated with the Trade Unions. ',\n '  4. _Dumas._ The word _duma_ means roughly \"deliberative body.\" The ',\n 'old Imperial Duma, which persisted six months after the Revolution, ',\n 'in a democratised form, died a natural death in September, 1917. The ',\n '_City Duma_ referred to in this book was the reorganised Municipal ',\n 'Council, often called \"Municipal Self-Government.\" It was elected by ',\n 'direct and secret ballot, and its only reason for failure to hold the ',\n 'masses during the Bolshevik Revolution was the general decline in ',\n 'influence of all purely _political_ representation in the fact of the ',\n 'growing power of organisations based on _economic_ groups. ',\n '  5. _Zemstvos._ May be roughly translated \"county councils.\" Under ',\n 'the Tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very little ',\n 'administrative power, developed and controlled largely by ',\n 'intellectual Liberals among the land-owning classes. Their most ',\n 'important function was education and social service among the ',\n 'peasants. During the war the _Zemstvos_ gradually took over the ',\n 'entire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army, as well as the ',\n 'buying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers generally ',\n 'corresponding to the work of the American Y. M. C. A. at the Front. ',\n 'After the March Revolution the _Zemstvos_ were democratized, with a ',\n 'view to making them the organs of local government in the rural ',\n 'districts. But like the _City Dumas,_ they could not compete with the ',\n '_Soviets._ ',\n \"  6. _Cooperatives._ These were the workers' and peasants' Consumers' \",\n 'Cooperative societies, which had several million members all over ',\n 'Russia before the Revolution. Founded by Liberals and \"moderate\" ',\n 'Socialists, the Cooperative movement was not supported by the ',\n 'revolutionary Socialist groups, because it was a substitute for the ',\n 'complete transference of means of production and distribution into ',\n 'the hands of the workers. After the March Revolution the ',\n '_Cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by Populist ',\n 'Socialists, Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, and acted as a ',\n 'conservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution. However, ',\n 'it was the _Cooperatives_ which fed Russia when the old structure of ',\n 'commerce and transportation collapsed. ',\n '  7. _Army Committees._ The _Army Committees_ were formed by the ',\n 'soldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the old ',\n 'regime officers. Every company, regiment, brigade, division and corps ',\n 'had its committee, over all of which was elected the _Army ',\n 'Committee._ The _Central Army Committee_ cooperated with the General ',\n 'Staff. The administrative break-down in the army incident upon the ',\n 'Revolution threw upon the shoulders of the _Army Committees_ most of ',\n \"the work of the Quartermaster's Department, and in some cases, even \",\n 'the command of troops. ',\n '  8. _Fleet Committees._ The corresponding organisations in the Navy. ',\n '                        Central Committees ',\n 'In the spring and summer of 1917, All-Russian conventions of every ',\n 'sort of organisation were held at Petrograd. There were national ',\n \"congresses of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Soviets, Trade \",\n 'Unions, Factory-Shop Committees, Army and Fleet Committees-besides ',\n 'every branch of the military and naval service, Cooperatives, ',\n 'Nationalities, etc. Each of these conventions elected a Central ',\n 'Committee, or a Central Executive Committee, to guard its particular ',\n 'interests at the seat of Government. As the Provisional Government ',\n 'grew weaker, these Central Committees were forced to assume more and ',\n 'more administrative powers. ',\n '  The most important Central Committees mentioned in this book are: ',\n '  _Union of Unions._ During the Revolution of 1905, Professor ',\n 'Miliukov and other Liberals established unions of professional ',\n 'men-doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. These were united under one ',\n 'central organisation, the _Union of Unions._ In 1905 the _Union of ',\n 'Unions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, the ',\n '_Union of Unions_ opposed the Bolshevik uprising, and united the ',\n 'Government employees who went on strike against the authority of the ',\n 'Soviets. ',\n '  _Tsay-ee-kah._ All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the ',\n \"Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. So called from the \",\n 'initials of its name. ',\n '  _Tsentroflot._ \"Centre-Fleet\"-the Central Fleet Committee. ',\n \"  _Vikzhel._ All-Russian Central Committee of the Railway Workers' \",\n 'Union. So called from the initials of its name. ',\n '                        Other Organisations ',\n '_Red Guards._ The armed factory workers of Russia. The _Red Guards_ ',\n 'were first formed during the Revolution of 1905, and sprang into ',\n 'existence again in the days of March, 1917, when a force was needed ',\n 'to keep order in the city. At that time they were armed, and all ',\n 'efforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more or ',\n 'less unsuccessful. At every great crisis in the Revolution the _Red ',\n 'Guards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, but ',\n 'full of Revolutionary zeal. ',\n '  _White Guards._ Bourgeois volunteers, who emerged in the last ',\n 'stages of the Revolution, to defend private property from the ',\n 'Bolshevik attempt to abolish it. A great many of them were University ',\n 'students. ',\n '  _Tekhintsi._ The so-called \"Savage Division\" in the army, made up ',\n 'of Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia, and personally devoted to ',\n 'General Kornilov. The _Tekhintsi_ were noted for their blind ',\n 'obedience and their savage cruelty in warfare. ',\n \"  _Death Battalions._ Or _Shock Battalions._ The Women's Battalion is \",\n 'known to the world as the _Death Battalion,_ but there were many ',\n '_Death Battalions_ composed of men. These were formed in the summer ',\n 'of 1917 by Kerensky, for the purpose of strengthening the discipline ',\n 'and combative fire of the army by heroic example. The _Death ',\n 'Battalions_ were composed mostly of intense young patriots. These ',\n 'came for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes. ',\n '  _Union of Officers._ An organisation formed among the reactionary ',\n 'officers in the army to combat politically the growing power of the ',\n 'Army Committees. ',\n '  _Knights of St. George._ The Cross of St. George was awarded for ',\n 'distinguished action in battle. Its holder automatically became a ',\n '_\"Knight of St. George.\"_ The predominant influence in the ',\n 'organisation was that of the supporters of the military idea. ',\n \"  _Peasants' Union._ In 1905, the _Peasants' Union_ was a \",\n \"revolutionary peasants' organisation. In 1917, however, it had become \",\n 'the political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to fight ',\n \"the growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants' \",\n 'Deputies. ',\n '                        Chronology and Spelling ',\n 'I have adopted in this book our Calendar throughout, instead of the ',\n 'former Russian Calendar, which was thirteen days earlier. ',\n '  In the spelling of Russian names and words, I have made no attempt ',\n 'to follow any scientific rules for transliteration, but have tried to ',\n 'give the spelling which would lead the English-speaking reader to the ',\n 'simplest approximation of their pronunciation. ',\n '                        Sources ',\n 'Much of the material in this book is from my own notes. I have also ',\n 'relied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of several hundred ',\n 'assorted Russian newspapers, covering almost every day of the time ',\n 'described, of files of the English paper, the _Russian Daily News,_ ',\n 'and of the two French papers, _Journal de Russie_ and _Entente._ But ',\n 'far more valuable than these is the _Bulletin de la Presse_ issued ',\n 'daily by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd, which reports ',\n 'all important happenings, speeches and the comment of the Russian ',\n 'press. Of this I have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917 ',\n 'to the end of January, 1918. ',\n '  Besides the foregoing, I have in my possession almost every ',\n 'proclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls of ',\n 'Petrograd from the middle of September, 1917, to the end of January, ',\n '1918. Also the official publication of all Government decrees and ',\n 'orders, and the official Government publication of the secret ',\n 'treaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign ',\n 'Affairs when the Bolsheviki took it over. ',\n '                  Ten Days That Shook The World ',\n '                              Chapter I ',\n '                             Background ',\n 'TOWARD the end of September, 1917, an alien Professor of Sociology ',\n 'visiting Russia came to see me in Petrograd. He had been informed by ',\n 'business men and intellectuals that the Revolution was slowing down. ',\n 'The Professor wrote an article about it, and then travelled around ',\n 'the country, visiting factory towns and peasant communities-where, to ',\n 'his astonishment, the Revolution seemed to be speeding up. Among the ',\n 'wage-earners and the land-working people it was common to hear talk ',\n 'of \"all land to the peasants, all factories to the workers.\" If the ',\n 'Professor had visited the front, he would have heard the whole Army ',\n 'talking Peace.... ',\n 'The Professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; both ',\n 'observations were correct. The property-owning classes were becoming ',\n 'more conservative, the masses of the people more radical. ',\n 'There was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_ ',\n 'generally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough, and lasted ',\n 'too long; that things should settle down. This sentiment was shared ',\n 'by the dominant \"moderate\" Socialist groups, the _oborontsi_ (See ',\n 'App. I, Sect. 1) Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, who ',\n 'supported the Provisional Government of Kerensky. ',\n 'On October 14th the official organ of the \"moderate\" Socialists said: ',\n 'The drama of Revolution has two acts; the destruction of the old ',\n 'régime and the creation of the new one. The first act has lasted long ',\n 'enough. Now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it as ',\n 'rapidly as possible. As a great revolutionist put it, \"Let us hasten, ',\n 'friends, to terminate the Revolution. He who makes it last too long ',\n 'will not gather the fruits....\" ',\n 'Among the worker, soldier and peasant masses, however, there was a ',\n 'stubborn feeling that the \"first act\" was not yet played out. On the ',\n 'front the Army Committees were always running foul of officers who ',\n 'could not get used to treating their men like human beings; in the ',\n 'rear the Land Committees elected by the peasants were being jailed ',\n 'for trying to carry out Government regulations concerning the land; ',\n 'and the workmen (See App. I, Sect. 2) in the factories were fighting ',\n 'black-lists and lockouts. Nay, furthermore, returning political ',\n 'exiles were being excluded from the country as \"undesirable\" ',\n 'citizens; and in some cases, men who returned from abroad to their ',\n 'villages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary acts ',\n 'committed in 1905. ',\n 'To the multiform discontent of the people the \"moderate\" Socialists ',\n 'had one answer: Wait for the Constituent Assembly, which is to meet ',\n 'in December. But the masses were not satisfied with that. The ',\n 'Constituent Assembly was all well and good; but there were certain ',\n 'definite things for which the Russian Revolution had been made, and ',\n 'for which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark Brotherhood ',\n 'Grave on Mars Field, that must be achieved Constituent Assembly or no ',\n \"Constituent Assembly: Peace, Land, and Workers' Control of Industry. \",\n 'The Constituent Assembly had been postponed and postponed-would ',\n 'probably be postponed again, until the people were calm ',\n 'enough-perhaps to modify their demands! At any rate, here were eight ',\n 'months of the Revolution gone, and little enough to show for it.... ',\n 'Meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simply ',\n 'deserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the great ',\n 'estates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... Of course, as was ',\n 'natural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted all ',\n 'their influence against any democratic compromise.... ',\n 'The policy of the Provisional Government alternated between ',\n 'ineffective reforms and stern repressive measures. An edict from the ',\n \"Socialist Minister of Labour ordered all the Workers' Committees \",\n 'henceforth to meet only after working hours. Among the troops at the ',\n 'front, \"agitators\" of opposition political parties were arrested, ',\n 'radical newspapers closed down, and capital punishment applied-to ',\n 'revolutionary propagandists. Attempts were made to disarm the Red ',\n 'Guard. Cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces.... ',\n 'These measures were supported by the \"moderate\" Socialists and their ',\n 'leaders in the Ministry, who considered it necessary to cooperate ',\n 'with the propertied classes. The people rapidly deserted them, and ',\n \"went over to the Bolsheviki, who stood for Peace, Land, and Workers' \",\n 'Control of Industry, and a Government of the working-class. In ',\n 'September, 1917, matters reached a crisis. Against the overwhelming ',\n 'sentiment of the country, Kerensky and the \"moderate\" Socialists ',\n 'succeeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with the ',\n 'propertied classes; and as a result, the Mensheviki and Socialist ',\n 'Revolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever. ',\n \"An article in _Rabotchi Put_ (Workers' Way) about the middle of \",\n 'October, entitled \"The Socialist Ministers,\" expressed the feeling of ',\n 'the masses of the people against the \"moderate\" Socialists: ',\n 'Here is a list of their services.(See App. I, Sect. 3) ',\n 'Tseretelli: disarmed the workmen with the assistance of General ',\n 'Polovtsev, checkmated the revolutionary soldiers, and approved of ',\n 'capital punishment in the army. ',\n 'Skobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of their ',\n 'profits, and finished-and finished by an attempt to dissolve the ',\n \"Workers' Committees in the shops and factories. \",\n 'Avksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members of the ',\n \"Land Committees, and suppressed dozens of workers' and soldiers' \",\n 'newspapers. ',\n 'Tchernov: signed the \"Imperial\" manifest, ordering the dissolution of ',\n 'the Finnish Diet. ',\n 'Savinkov: concluded an open alliance with General Kornilov. If this ',\n 'saviour of the country was not able to betray Petrograd, it was due ',\n 'to reasons over which he had no control. ',\n 'Zarudny: with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky, put some of the ',\n 'best workers of the Revolution, soldiers and sailors, in prison. ',\n 'Nikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway Workers. ',\n 'Kerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. The list of his ',\n 'services is too long.... ',\n 'A Congress of delegates of the Baltic Fleet, at Helsingfors, passed a ',\n 'resolution which began as follows: ',\n 'We demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the Provisional ',\n 'Government of the \"Socialist,\" the political adventurer-Kerensky, as ',\n 'one who is scandalising and ruining the great Revolution, and with it ',\n 'the revolutionary masses, by his shameless political blackmail on ',\n 'behalf of the bourgeoisie.... ',\n 'The direct result of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki.... ',\n 'Since March, 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers ',\n 'beating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Duma ',\n 'to assume the supreme power in Russia, it was the masses of the ',\n 'people, workers, soldiers and peasants, which forced every change in ',\n 'the course of the Revolution. They hurled the Miliukov Ministry down; ',\n 'it was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world the Russian peace ',\n 'terms-\"No annexations, no indemnities, and the right of ',\n 'self-determination of peoples\"; and again, in July, it was the ',\n 'spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once more ',\n 'stormed the Tauride Palace, to demand that the Soviets take over the ',\n 'Government of Russia. ',\n 'The Bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at the ',\n 'head of the movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of the ',\n 'rising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderless ',\n \"hordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd's _St. \",\n 'Antoine._ Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki; hundreds ',\n 'were imprisoned, among them Trotzky, Madame Kollontai and Kameniev; ',\n 'Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; the ',\n 'Bolshevik papers were suppressed. Provocators and reactionaries ',\n 'raised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents, until people ',\n 'all over the world believed it. ',\n 'But the Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiate ',\n 'its accusations; the documents proving pro-German conspiracy were ',\n 'discovered to be forgeries; [*] and one by one the Bolsheviki were ',\n '[*Part of the famous \"Sisson Documents\"] ',\n 'released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail-until only ',\n 'six remained. The impotence and indecision of the ever-changing ',\n 'Provisional Government was an argument nobody could refute. The ',\n 'Bolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, \"All Power ',\n 'to the Soviets!\"-and they were not merely self-seeking, for at that ',\n 'time the majority of the Soviets was \"moderate\" Socialist, their ',\n 'bitter enemy. ',\n 'But more potent still, they took the crude, simple desires of the ',\n 'workers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediate ',\n 'programme. And so, while the _oborontsi_ Mensheviki and Socialist ',\n 'Revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the ',\n 'bourgeoisie, the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses. In ',\n 'July they were hunted and despised; by September the metropolitan ',\n 'workmen, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers, had been ',\n 'won almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal elections ',\n 'in the large cities (See App. I, Sect. 4) were significant; only 18 ',\n 'per cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary, ',\n 'against more than 70 per cent in June.... ',\n 'There remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the fact ',\n 'that the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets, the Central ',\n 'Army and Fleet Committees, [*] and the Central Committees of some of ',\n '[*See Notes and Explanations.] ',\n 'the Unions-notably, the Post and Telegraph Workers and the Railway ',\n 'Workers-opposed the Bolsheviki with the utmost violence. These ',\n 'Central Committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer, ',\n 'or even before, when the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries had ',\n 'an enormous following; and they delayed or prevented any new ',\n 'elections. Thus, according to the constitution of the Soviets of ',\n \"Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, the All-Russian Congress _should \",\n 'have been called in September;_ but the _Tsay-ee-kah_ [*] would not ',\n '[*See Notes and Explanations.] ',\n 'call the meeting, on the ground that the Constituent Assembly was ',\n 'only two months away, at which time, they hinted, the Soviets would ',\n 'abdicate. Meanwhile, one by one, the Bolsheviki were winning in the ',\n 'local Soviets all over the country, in the Union branches and the ',\n \"ranks of the soldiers and sailors. The Peasants' Soviets remained \",\n 'still conservative, because in the sluggish rural districts political ',\n 'consciousness developed slowly, and the Socialist Revolutionary party ',\n 'had been for a generation the party which had agitated among the ',\n 'peasants.... But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was ',\n 'forming. It showed itself clearly in October, when the left wing of ',\n 'the Socialist Revolutionaries split off, and formed a new political ',\n 'faction, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. ',\n 'At the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces of ',\n 'reaction were gaining confidence.(See App. I, Sect. 5) At the ',\n 'Troitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd, for example, a burlesque called ',\n '_Sins of the Tsar_ was interrupted by a group of Monarchists, who ',\n 'threatened to lynch the actors for \"insulting the Emperor.\" Certain ',\n 'newspapers began to sigh for a \"Russian Napoleon.\" It was the usual ',\n 'thing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the Soviets of ',\n \"Workers' Deputies (Rabotchikh Deputatov) as _Sabatchikh_ \",\n \"Deputatov-Dogs' Deputies. \",\n 'On October 15th I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist, ',\n 'Stepan Georgevitch Lianozov, known as the \"Russian Rockefeller\"-a ',\n 'Cadet by political faith. ',\n '\"Revolution,\" he said, \"is a sickness. Sooner or later the foreign ',\n 'powers must intervene here-as one would intervene to cure a sick ',\n 'child, and teach it how to walk. Of course it would be more or less ',\n 'improper, but the nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism in ',\n \"their own countries-such contagious ideas as 'proletarian \",\n \"dictatorship,' and 'world social revolution'... There is a chance that \",\n 'this intervention may not be necessary. Transportation is ',\n 'demoralised, the factories are closing down, and the Germans are ',\n 'advancing. Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian people to ',\n 'their senses....\" ',\n 'Mr. Lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, it ',\n 'would be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit the ',\n \"existence of the workers' Shop Committees, or to allow the workers \",\n 'any share in the management of industry. ',\n '\"As for the Bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of two ',\n 'methods. The Government can evacuate Petrograd, then a state of siege ',\n 'declared, and the military commander of the district can deal with ',\n 'these gentlemen without legal formalities.... _Or if, for example, the ',\n 'Constituent Assembly manifests any Utopian tendencies, it can be ',\n 'dispersed by force of arms....\"_ ',\n 'Winter was coming on-the terrible Russian winter. I heard business ',\n 'men speak of it so: \"Winter was always Russia\\'s best friend. Perhaps ',\n 'now it will rid us of Revolution.\" On the freezing front miserable ',\n 'armies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. The railways ',\n 'were breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. The desperate ',\n 'masses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of the ',\n 'people, causing defeat on the Front. Riga had been surrendered just ',\n 'after General Kornilov said publicly, \"Must we pay with Riga the ',\n 'price of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?\" [*] ',\n '[* See \"Kornilov to Brest-Litvosk\" by John Reed. Boni and Liveright ',\n 'N.Y., 1919] ',\n 'To Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to ',\n 'such a pitch. But I have personally met officers on the Northern ',\n 'Front who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with the ',\n \"Soldiers' Committees. The secretary of the Petrograd branch of the \",\n \"Cadet party told me that the break-down of the country's economic \",\n 'life was part of a campaign to discredit the Revolution. An Allied ',\n 'diplomat, whose name I promised not to mention, confirmed this from ',\n 'his own knowledge. I know of certain coal-mines near Kharkov which ',\n 'were fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories at ',\n 'Moscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left, ',\n 'of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of crippling ',\n 'locomotives.... ',\n 'A large section of the propertied classes preferred the Germans to ',\n \"the Revolution-even to the Provisional Government-and didn't hesitate \",\n 'to say so. In the Russian household where I lived, the subject of ',\n 'conversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming of ',\n 'the Germans, bringing \"law and order.\"... One evening I spent at the ',\n 'house of a Moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven people at ',\n 'the table whether they preferred \"Wilhelm or the Bolsheviki.\" The ',\n 'vote was ten to one for Wilhelm... ',\n 'The speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation to ',\n 'pile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry or the ',\n 'corruption of Government officials. Foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded, ',\n 'or secretly sent out of the country to Sweden. In the first four ',\n 'months of the Revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies were ',\n 'almost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses of ',\n \"Petrograd, until the two-years' provision of grain had fallen to less \",\n 'than enough to feed the city for one month.... According to the ',\n 'official report of the last Minister of Supplies in the Provisional ',\n 'Government, coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two rubles ',\n 'a pound, and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen. In all the ',\n 'stores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but only ',\n 'the rich could buy them. ',\n 'In a provincial town I knew a merchant family turned ',\n 'speculator_-maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the Russians call it. The three ',\n 'sons had bribed their way out of military service. One gambled in ',\n 'foodstuffs. Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines to ',\n 'mysterious parties in Finland. The third owned a controlling interest ',\n 'in a chocolate factory, which supplied the local Cooperative ',\n 'societies-on condition that the Cooperatives furnished him everything ',\n 'he needed. And so, while the masses of the people got a quarter pound ',\n 'of black bread on their bread cards, he had an abundance of white ',\n 'bread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and butter.... Yet when the soldiers at ',\n 'the front could no longer fight from cold, hunger and exhaustion, how ',\n 'indignantly did this family scream \"Cowards!\"-how \"ashamed\" they were ',\n '\"to be Russians\"... When finally the Bolsheviki found and requisitioned ',\n 'vast hoarded stores of provisions, what \"Robbers\" they were. ',\n 'Beneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time Dark Forces, ',\n 'unchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second, secret still and ',\n 'very active. The agents of the notorious _Okhrana_ still functioned, ',\n 'for and against the Tsar, for and against Kerensky-whoever would ',\n 'pay.... In the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, such ',\n 'as the Black Hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction in ',\n 'some form or other. ',\n 'In this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous half-truths, one clear ',\n 'note sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of the Bolsheviki, ',\n '\"All Power to the Soviets! All power to the direct representatives of ',\n 'millions on millions of common workers, soldiers, peasants. Land, ',\n 'bread, an end to the senseless war, an end to secret diplomacy, ',\n 'speculation, treachery.... The Revolution is in danger, and with it the ',\n 'cause of the people all over the world!\" ',\n 'The struggle between the proletariat and the middle class, between ',\n 'the Soviets and the Government, which had begun in the first March ',\n 'days, was about to culminate. Having at one bound leaped from the ',\n 'Middle Ages into the twentieth century, Russia showed the startled ',\n 'world two systems of Revolution-the political and the social-in ',\n 'mortal combat. ',\n 'What a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution, after ',\n 'all these months of starvation and disillusionment! The bourgeoisie ',\n 'should have better known its Russia. Not for a long time in Russia ',\n 'will the \"sickness\" of Revolution have run its course.... ',\n 'Looking back, Russia before the November insurrection seems of ',\n 'another age, almost incredibly conservative. So quickly did we adapt ',\n 'ourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as Russian politics swung ',\n 'bodily to the Left-until the Cadets were outlawed as \"enemies of the ',\n 'people,\" Kerensky became a \"counter-revolutionist,\" the \"middle\" ',\n 'Socialist leaders, Tseretelli, Dan, Lieber, Gotz and Avksentiev, were ',\n 'too reactionary for their following, and men like Victor Tchernov, ',\n 'and even Maxim Gorky, belonged to the Right Wing.... ',\n 'About the middle of December, 1917, a group of Socialist ',\n 'Revolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George Buchanan, ',\n 'the British Ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact that ',\n 'they had been there, because they were \"considered too far Right.\" ',\n '\"And to think,\" said Sir George. \"One year ago my Government ',\n 'instructed me not to receive Miliukov, because he was so dangerously ',\n 'Left!\" ',\n 'September and October are the worst months of the Russian ',\n 'year-especially the Petrograd year. Under dull grey skies, in the ',\n 'shortening days, the rain fell drenching, incessant. The mud ',\n 'underfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked everywhere by ',\n 'heavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete break-down ',\n 'of the Municipal administration. Bitter damp winds rushed in from the ',\n 'Gulf of Finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. At ',\n 'night, for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins, the ',\n 'street-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings and ',\n \"apartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o'clock until \",\n 'midnight, with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to be ',\n 'had. It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning. ',\n 'Robberies and housebreakings increased. In apartment houses the men ',\n 'took turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. This ',\n 'was under the Provisional Government. ',\n 'Week by week food became scarcer. The daily allowance of bread fell ',\n 'from a pound and a half to a pound, then three quarters, half, and a ',\n 'quarter-pound. Toward the end there was a week without any bread at ',\n 'all. Sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month-if ',\n 'one could get it at all, which was seldom. A bar of chocolate or a ',\n 'pound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles-at ',\n 'least a dollar. There was milk for about half the babies in the city; ',\n 'most hotels and private houses never saw it for months. In the fruit ',\n 'season apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on ',\n 'the street-corner.... ',\n 'For milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in _queue_ ',\n 'long hours in the chill rain. Coming home from an all-night meeting I ',\n 'have seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before dawn, mostly ',\n 'women, some with babies in their arms.... Carlyle, in his _French ',\n 'Revolution,_ has described the French people as distinguished above ',\n 'all others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ Russia had ',\n 'accustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of Nicholas ',\n 'the Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continued ',\n 'intermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as the ',\n 'regular order of things. Think of the poorly-clad people standing on ',\n 'the iron-white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian winter! ',\n 'I have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note of ',\n 'discontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculous ',\n 'goodnature of the Russian crowd.... ',\n 'Of course all the theatres were going every night, including Sundays. ',\n 'Karsavina appeared in a new Ballet at the Marinsky, all dance-loving ',\n 'Russia coming to see her. Shaliapin was singing. At the Alexandrinsky ',\n 'they were reviving Meyerhold\\'s production of Tolstoy\\'s \"Death of Ivan ',\n 'the Terrible\"; and at that performance I remember noticing a student ',\n 'of the Imperial School of Pages, in his dress uniform, who stood up ',\n 'correctly between the acts and faced the empty Imperial box, with its ',\n 'eagles all erased.... The _Krivoye Zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous version ',\n 'of Schnitzler\\'s \"Reigen.\" ',\n 'Although the Hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuated ',\n 'to Moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of paintings. Hordes of the ',\n 'female _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on Art, Literature and ',\n 'the Easy Philosophies. It was a particularly active season for ',\n 'Theosophists. And the Salvation Army, admitted to Russia for the ',\n 'first time in history, plastered the walls with announcements of ',\n 'gospel meetings, which amused and astounded Russian audiences.... ',\n 'As in all such times, the petty conventional life of the city went ',\n 'on, ignoring the Revolution as much as possible. The poets made ',\n 'verses-but not about the Revolution. The realistic painters painted ',\n 'scenes from mediæval Russian history-anything but the Revolution. ',\n 'Young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learn ',\n 'French and cultivate their voices, and the gay young beautiful ',\n 'officers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and their ',\n 'elaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. The ladies of ',\n 'the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon, ',\n 'carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, and ',\n 'half a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were back, ',\n 'or that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve the ',\n 'servant problem.... The daughter of a friend of mine came home one ',\n 'afternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor had ',\n 'called her \"Comrade!\" ',\n 'All around them great Russia was in travail, bearing a new world. The ',\n 'servants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing, were ',\n 'getting independent. A pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles, ',\n 'and as wages averaged about thirty-five rubles a month the servants ',\n 'refused to stand in _queue_ and wear out their shoes. But more than ',\n 'that. In the new Russia every man and woman could vote; there were ',\n 'working-class newspapers, saying new and startling things; there were ',\n 'the Soviets; and there were the Unions. The _izvoshtchiki_ ',\n '(cab-drivers) had a Union; they were also represented in the ',\n 'Petrograd Soviet. The waiters and hotel servants were organised, and ',\n 'refused tips. On the walls of restaurants they put up signs which ',\n 'read, \"No tips taken here-\" or, \"Just because a man has to make his ',\n 'living waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him a ',\n 'tip!\" ',\n 'At the Front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers, ',\n 'and learned self-government through their committees. In the ',\n 'factories those unique Russian organisations, the Factory-Shop ',\n 'Committees, [*] gained experience and strength and a realisation of ',\n '[* See Notes and Explanations] ',\n 'their historical mission by combat with the old order. All Russia was ',\n 'learning to read, and _reading-_politics, economics, history-because ',\n 'the people wanted to _know...._ In every city, in most towns, along the ',\n 'Front, each political faction had its newspaper-sometimes several. ',\n 'Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands of ',\n 'organisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, the ',\n 'factories, the streets. The thirst for education, so long thwarted, ',\n 'burst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression. From Smolny ',\n 'Institute alone, the first six months, went out every day tons, ',\n 'car-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. Russia ',\n 'absorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. And ',\n 'it was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the cheap ',\n 'fiction that corrupts-but social and economic theories, philosophy, ',\n 'the works of Tolstoy, Gogol, and Gorky.... ',\n 'Then the Talk, beside which Carlyle\\'s \"flood of French speech\" was a ',\n 'mere trickle. Lectures, debates, speeches-in theatres, circuses, ',\n 'school-houses, clubs, Soviet meeting-rooms, Union headquarters, ',\n 'barracks.... Meetings in the trenches at the Front, in village squares, ',\n 'factories.... What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod (the ',\n 'Putilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to Social ',\n 'Democrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whatever ',\n 'they had to say, as long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd, ',\n 'and all over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. In ',\n 'railway trains, street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptu ',\n 'debate, everywhere.... ',\n 'And the All-Russian Conferences and Congresses, drawing together the ',\n 'men of two continents-conventions of Soviets, of Cooperatives, ',\n 'Zemstvos, [*] nationalities, priests, peasants, political parties; the ',\n '[* See Notes and Explanations] ',\n 'Democratic Conference, the Moscow Conference, the Council of the ',\n 'Russian Republic. There were always three or four conventions going ',\n 'on in Petrograd. At every meeting, attempts to limit the time of ',\n 'speakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought that ',\n 'was in him.... ',\n 'We came down to the front of the Twelfth Army, back of Riga, where ',\n 'gaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; and ',\n 'when they saw us they started up, with their pinched faces and the ',\n 'flesh showing blue through their torn clothing, demanding eagerly, ',\n '\"Did you bring anything to _read?\"_ ',\n 'What though the outward and visible signs of change were many, what ',\n 'though the statue of Catharine the Great before the Alexandrinsky ',\n 'Theatre bore a little red flag in its hand, and others-somewhat ',\n 'faded-floated from all public buildings; and the Imperial monograms ',\n 'and eagles were either torn down or covered up; and in place of the ',\n ...]"

',\n 'naturally most of it deals with \\x93red petrograd,\\x94 the capital and heart ',\n 'of the insurrection. but the reader must realize that what took place ',\n 'in petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or lesser ',\n 'intensity, at different intervals of time, all over russia. ',\n 'in this book, the first of several which i am writing, i must confine ',\n 'myself to a chronicle of those events which i myself observed and ',\n 'experienced, and those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by two ',\n 'chapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the november ',\n 'revolution. i am aware that these two chapters make difficult reading, ',\n 'but they are essential to an understanding of what follows. ',\n 'many questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader. what ',\n 'is bolshevism? what kind of a governmental structure did the bolsheviki ',\n 'set up? if the bolsheviki championed the constituent assembly before ',\n 'the november revolution, why did they disperse it by force of arms ',\n 'afterward? and if the bourgeoisie opposed the constituent assembly ',\n 'until the danger of bolshevism became apparent, why did they champion ',\n 'it afterward? ',\n 'these and many other questions cannot be answered here. in another ',\n 'volume, \\x93kornilov to brest-litovsk,\\x94 i trace the course of the ',\n 'revolution up to and including the german  peace. there i explain the ',\n 'origin and functions of the revolutionary organisations, the evolution ',\n 'of popular sentiment, the dissolution of the constituent assembly, the ',\n 'structure of the soviet state, and the course and outcome of the brest- ',\n 'litovsk negotiations\\x85. ',\n 'in considering the rise of the bolsheviki it is necessary to understand ',\n 'that russian economic life and the russian army were not disorganised ',\n 'on november 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the logical result of ',\n 'a process which began as far back as 1915. the corrupt reactionaries in ',\n 'control of the tsar\\x92s court deliberately undertook to wreck russia in ',\n 'order to make a separate peace with germany. the lack of arms on the ',\n 'front, which had caused the great retreat of the summer of 1915, the ',\n 'lack of food in the army and in the great cities, the break-down of ',\n 'manufactures and transportation in 1916\\x97all these we know now were part ',\n 'of a gigantic campaign of sabotage. this was halted just in time by the ',\n 'march revolution. ',\n 'for the first few months of the new régime, in spite of the confusion ',\n 'incident upon a great revolution, when one hundred and sixty millions ',\n 'of the world\\x92s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, both ',\n 'the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually ',\n 'improved. ',\n 'but the \\x93honeymoon\\x94 was short. the propertied classes wanted merely a ',\n 'political revolution, which would take the power from the tsar and give ',\n 'it to them. they wanted russia to be a constitutional republic, like ',\n 'france or the united states; or a constitutional monarchy, like ',\n 'england. on the other hand, the masses of the people wanted real ',\n 'industrial and agrarian democracy. ',\n 'william english walling, in his book, \\x93russia\\x92s message,\\x94 an account of ',\n 'the revolution of 1905, describes very well the state of mind of the ',\n 'russian workers, who were later to support bolshevism almost ',\n 'unanimously: ',\n 'they (the working people) saw it was possible that even under a free ',\n 'government, if it fell into the hands of other social classes, they ',\n 'might still continue to starve\\x85. ',\n 'the russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither violent, ',\n 'dogmatic, nor unintelligent. he is ready for barricades, but he has ',\n 'studied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has learned ',\n 'about them from actual experience. he is ready and willing to fight his ',\n 'oppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. but he does not ignore ',\n 'the existence of other classes. he merely asks that the other classes ',\n 'take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near\\x85. ',\n 'they (the workers) were all agreed that our (american) political ',\n 'institutions were preferable to their own, but they were not very ',\n 'anxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the capitalist ',\n 'class)\\x85. ',\n 'the workingmen of russia did not have themselves shot down, executed by ',\n 'hundreds in moscow, riga and odessa, imprisoned by thousands in every ',\n 'russian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions, in ',\n 'exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of goldfields ',\n 'and cripple creek\\x85. ',\n 'and so developed in russia, in the midst of a foreign war, the social ',\n 'revolution on top of the political revolution, culminating in the ',\n 'triumph of bolshevism. ',\n 'mr. a. j. sack, director in this country of the russian information ',\n 'bureau, which opposes the soviet government, has this to say in his ',\n 'book, \\x93the birth of the russian democracy\\x94: the bolsheviks organised ',\n 'their own cabinet, with nicholas lenine as premier and leon trotsky\\x97 ',\n 'minister of foreign affairs. the inevitability of their coming into ',\n 'power became evident almost immediately after the march revolution. the ',\n 'history of the bolsheviki, after the revolution, is a history of their ',\n 'steady growth\\x85. ',\n 'foreigners, and americans especially, frequently emphasise the ',\n '\\x93ignorance\\x94 of the russian workers. it is true they lacked the ',\n 'political experience of the peoples of the west, but they were very ',\n 'well trained in voluntary organisation. in 1917 there were more than ',\n 'twelve million members of the russian consumers\\x92 cooperative societies; ',\n 'and the soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their ',\n 'organising genius. moreover, there is probably not a people in the ',\n 'world so well educated in socialist theory and its practical ',\n 'application. ',\n 'william english walling thus characterises them: ',\n 'the russian working people are for the most part able to read and ',\n 'write. for many years the country has been in such a disturbed ',\n 'condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of ',\n 'intelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of the ',\n 'equally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the working ',\n 'people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of ',\n 'russia\\x85. ',\n 'many writers explain their hostility to the soviet government by ',\n 'arguing that the last phase of the russian revolution was simply a ',\n 'struggle of the \\x93respectable\\x94 elements against the brutal attacks of ',\n 'bolshevism. however, it was the propertied classes, who, when they ',\n 'realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary ',\n 'organisations, undertook to destroy them and to halt the revolution. to ',\n 'this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures. ',\n 'in order to wreck the kerensky ministry and the soviets, transportation ',\n 'was disorganised and internal troubles provoked; to crush the factory- ',\n 'shop committees, plants were shut down, and fuel and raw materials ',\n 'diverted; to break the army committees at the front, capital punishment ',\n 'was restored and military defeat connived at. ',\n 'this was all excellent fuel for the bolshevik fire. the bolsheviki ',\n 'retorted by preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy of ',\n 'the soviets. ',\n 'between these two extremes, with the other factions which whole- ',\n 'heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the so-called ',\n '\\x93moderate\\x94 socialists, the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries, ',\n 'and several smaller parties. these groups were also attacked by the ',\n 'propertied classes, but their power of resistance was crippled by their ',\n 'theories. ',\n 'roughly, the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries believed that ',\n 'russia was not economically ripe for a social revolution\\x97that only a ',\n '_political_ revolution was possible. according to their interpretation, ',\n 'the russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power; any ',\n 'attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means of ',\n 'which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old régime. and so it ',\n 'followed that when the \\x93moderate\\x94 socialists were forced to assume the ',\n 'power, they were afraid to use it. ',\n 'they believed that russia must pass through the stages of political and ',\n 'economic development known to western europe, and emerge at last, with ',\n 'the rest of the world, into full-fledged socialism. naturally, ',\n 'therefore, they agreed with the propertied classes that russia must ',\n 'first be a parliamentary state\\x97though with some improvements on the ',\n 'western democracies. as a consequence, they insisted upon the ',\n 'collaboration of the propertied classes in the government. ',\n 'from this it was an easy step to supporting them. the \\x93moderate\\x94 ',\n 'socialists needed the bourgeoisie. but the bourgeoisie did not need the ',\n '\\x93moderate\\x94 socialists. so it resulted in the socialist ministers being ',\n 'obliged to give way, little by little, on their entire program, while ',\n 'the propertied classes grew more and more insistent. ',\n 'and at the end, when the bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise, ',\n 'the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries found themselves fighting ',\n 'on the side of the propertied classes\\x85. in almost every country in the ',\n 'world to-day the same phenomenon is visible. ',\n 'instead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that the ',\n 'bolsheviki were the only party in russia with a constructive program ',\n 'and the power to impose it on the country. if they had not succeeded to ',\n 'the government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind that the ',\n 'armies of imperial germany would have been in petrograd and moscow in ',\n 'december, and russia would again be ridden by a tsar\\x85. ',\n 'it is still fashionable, after a whole year of the soviet government, ',\n 'to speak of the bolshevik insurrection as an \\x93adventure.\\x94 adventure it ',\n 'was, and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon, ',\n 'sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses, and staking ',\n 'everything on their vast and simple desires. already the machinery had ',\n 'been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed ',\n 'among the peasants. the factory-shop committees and the trade unions ',\n 'were there to put into operation workers\\x92 control of industry. in every ',\n 'village, town, city, district and province there were soviets of ',\n 'workers\\x92, soldiers\\x92 and peasants\\x92 deputies, prepared to assume the task ',\n 'of local administration. ',\n 'no matter what one thinks of bolshevism, it is undeniable that the ',\n 'russian revolution is one of the great events of human history, and the ',\n 'rise of the bolsheviki a phenomenon of world-wide importance. just as ',\n 'historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of ',\n 'the paris commune, so they will want to know what happened in petrograd ',\n 'in november, 1917, the spirit which animated the people, and how the ',\n 'leaders looked, talked and acted. it is with this in view that i have ',\n 'written this book. ',\n 'in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral. but in telling the ',\n 'story of those great days i have tried to see events with the eye of a ',\n 'conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth.

',\n '                        notes and explanations ',\n 'to the average reader the multiplicity of russian ',\n 'organisations-political groups, committees and central committees, ',\n 'soviets, dumas and unions-will prove extremely confusing. for this ',\n 'reason i am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations. ',\n '                        political parties ',\n 'in the elections to the constituent assembly, there were seventeen ',\n 'tickets in petrograd, and in some of the provincial towns as many as ',\n 'forty; but the following summary of the aims and composition of ',\n 'political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in ',\n 'this book. only the essence of their programmes and the general ',\n 'character of their constituencies can be noticed.... ',\n '  1. _monarchists,_ of various shades, _octobrists,_ etc. these ',\n 'once-powerful factions no longer existed openly; they either worked ',\n 'underground, or their members joined the _cadets,_ as the _cadets_ ',\n 'came by degrees to stand for their political programme.

',\n '  2. _cadets._ so-called from the initials of its name, ',\n 'constitutional democrats. its official name is \"party of the people\\'s ',\n 'freedom.\" under the tsar composed of liberals from the propertied ',\n 'classes, the _cadets_ were the great party of _political_ reform, ',\n 'roughly corresponding to the progressive party in america. when the ',\n 'revolution broke out in march, 1917, the _cadets_ formed the first ',\n 'provisional government. the _cadet_ ministry was overthrown in april ',\n 'because it declared itself in favour of allied imperialistic aims, ',\n \"including the imperialistic aims of the tsar's government. as the \",\n 'revolution became more and more a _social economic_ revolution, the ',\n '_cadets_ grew more and more conservative. its representatives in this ',\n 'book are: miliukov, vinaver, shatsky. ',\n '  2a. _group of public men._ after the _cadets_ had become unpopular ',\n 'through their relations with the kornilov counter-revolution, the ',\n '_group of public men_ was formed in moscow. delegates from the _group ',\n 'of public men_ were given portfolios in the last kerensky cabinet. ',\n 'the _group_ declared itself non-partisan, although its intellectual ',\n 'leaders were men like rodzianko and shulgin. it was composed of the ',\n 'more \"modern\" bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who were ',\n 'intelligent enough to realise that the soviets must be fought by ',\n 'their own weapon-economic organisation. typical of the _group:_ ',\n 'lianozov, konovalov. ',\n '  3. _populist socialists,_ or _trudoviki_ (labour group). ',\n 'numerically a small party, composed of cautious intellectuals, the ',\n 'leaders of the cooperative societies, and conservative peasants. ',\n 'professing to be socialists, the _populists_ really supported the ',\n 'interests of the petty bourgeoisie-clerks, shopkeepers, etc. by ',\n 'direct descent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of the ',\n 'labour group in the fourth imperial duma, which was composed largely ',\n 'of peasant representatives. kerensky was the leader of the ',\n '_trudoviki_ in the imperial duma when the revolution of march, 1917, ',\n 'broke out. the _populist socialists_ are a nationalistic party. their ',\n 'representatives in this book are: peshekhanov, tchaikovsky. ',\n '  4. _russian social democratic labour party._ originally marxian ',\n 'socialists. at a party congress held in 1903, the party split, on the ',\n 'question of tactics, into two factions-the majority (bolshinstvo), ',\n 'and the minority (menshinstvo). from this sprang the names ',\n '\"bolsheviki\" and \"mensheviki\"-\"members of the majority\" and \"members ',\n 'of the minority.\" these two wings became two separate parties, both ',\n 'calling themselves \"russian social democratic labour party,\" and both ',\n 'professing to be marxians. since the revolution of 1905 the ',\n 'bolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again the majority in ',\n 'september, 1917. ',\n '  a. _mensheviki._ this party includes all shades of socialists who ',\n 'believe that society must progress by natural evolution toward ',\n 'socialism, and that the working-class must conquer political power ',\n 'first. also a nationalistic party. this was the party of the ',\n 'socialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of education ',\n 'having been in the hands of the propertied classes, the intellectuals ',\n 'instinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of the ',\n 'propertied classes. among their representatives in this book are: ',\n 'dan, lieber, tseretelli. ',\n '  b. _mensheviki internationalists._ the radical wing of the ',\n '_mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all coalition with the ',\n 'propertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from the ',\n 'conservative mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of the ',\n 'working-class advocated by the bolsheviki. trotzky was long a member ',\n 'of this group. among their leaders: martov, martinov. ',\n '  c. _bolsheviki._ now call themselves the _communist party,_ in ',\n 'order to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of ',\n '\"moderate\" or \"parliamentary\" socialism, which dominates the ',\n 'mensheviki and the so-called majority socialists in all countries. ',\n 'the _bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, and ',\n 'seizure of the reins of government, in order to hasten the coming of ',\n 'socialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural resources ',\n 'and financial institutions. this party expresses the desires chiefly ',\n 'of the factory workers, but also of a large section of the poor ',\n 'peasants. the name \"bolshevik\" can _not_ be translated by ',\n '\"maximalist.\" the maximalists are a separate group. (see paragraph ',\n '5b). among the leaders: lenin, trotzky, lunatcharsky. ',\n '  d. _united social democrats internationalists._ also called the ',\n '_novaya zhizn_ (new life) group, from the name of the very ',\n 'influential newspaper which was its organ. a little group of ',\n 'intellectuals with a very small following among the working-class, ',\n 'except the personal following of maxim gorky, its leader. ',\n 'intellectuals, with almost the same programme as the _mensheviki ',\n 'internationalists,_ except that the _novaya zhizn_ group refused to ',\n 'be tied to either of the two great factions. opposed the bolshevik ',\n 'tactics, but remained in the soviet government. other representatives ',\n 'in this book: avilov, kramarov. ',\n '  e. _yedinstvo._ a very small and dwindling group, composed almost ',\n 'entirely of the personal following of plekhanov, one of the pioneers ',\n \"of the russian social democratic movement in the 80's, and its \",\n 'greatest theoretician. now an old man, plekhanov was extremely ',\n 'patriotic, too conservative even for the mensheviki. after the ',\n \"bolshevik _coup d'etat, yedinstvo_ disappeared. \",\n '  5. _socialist revolutionary party._ called _essaires_ from the ',\n 'initials of their name. originally the revolutionary party of the ',\n 'peasants, the party of the fighting organisations-the terrorists. ',\n 'after the march revolution, it was joined by many who had never been ',\n 'socialists. at that time it stood for the abolition of private ',\n 'property in land only, the owners to be compensated in some fashion. ',\n 'finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the ',\n '_essaires_ to abandon the \"compensation\" clause, and led to the ',\n 'younger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main party ',\n 'in the fall of 1917 and forming a new party, the _left socialist ',\n 'revolutionary party._ the _essaires,_ who were afterward always ',\n 'called by the radical groups _\"right socialist revolutionaries,\"_ ',\n 'adopted the political attitude of the mensheviki, and worked together ',\n 'with them. they finally came to represent the wealthier peasants, the ',\n 'intellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of remote ',\n 'rural districts. among them there was, however, a wider difference of ',\n 'shades of political and economic opinion than among the mensheviki. ',\n 'among their leaders mentioned in these pages: avksentiev, gotz, ',\n 'kerensky, tchernov, \"babuschka\" breshkovskaya. ',\n '  a. _left socialist revolutionaries._ although theoretically sharing ',\n 'the bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working-class, at ',\n 'first were reluctant to follow the ruthless bolshevik tactics. ',\n 'however, the _left socialist revolutionaries_ remained in the soviet ',\n 'government, sharing the cabinet portfolios, especially that of ',\n 'agriculture. they withdrew from the government several times, but ',\n 'always returned. as the peasants left the ranks of the _essaires_ in ',\n 'increasing numbers, they joined the _left socialist revolutionary ',\n 'party,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the soviet ',\n 'government, standing for confiscation without compensation of the ',\n 'great landed estates, and their disposition by the peasants ',\n 'themselves. among the leaders: spiridonova, karelin, kamkov, ',\n 'kalagayev. ',\n '  b. _maximalists._ an off-shoot of the _socialist revolutionary ',\n 'party_ in the revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful peasant ',\n 'movement, demanding the immediate application of the maximum ',\n 'socialist programme. now an insignificant group of peasant ',\n 'anarchists. ',\n '                        parliamentary procedure ',\n 'russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental ',\n 'model rather than our own. the first action is usually the election ',\n 'of officers and the _presidium._ ',\n '  the _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed of ',\n 'representatives of the groups and political factions represented in ',\n 'the assembly, in proportion to their numbers. the _presidium_ ',\n 'arranges the order of business, and its members can be called upon by ',\n 'the president to take the chair _pro tem._ ',\n '  each question (_vopros_) is stated in a general way and then ',\n 'debated, and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by ',\n 'the different factions, and each one voted on separately. the order ',\n 'of business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the first ',\n 'half hour. on the plea of \"emergency,\" which the crowd almost always ',\n 'grants, anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any ',\n 'subject. the crowd controls the meeting, practically the only ',\n 'functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little ',\n 'bell, and to recognise speakers. almost all the real work of the ',\n 'session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political ',\n 'factions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and are ',\n 'represented by floor-leaders. the result is, however, that at every ',\n 'important new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to enable ',\n 'the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus. ',\n '  the crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling speakers, ',\n 'over-riding the plans of the _presidium._ among the customary cries ',\n 'are: _\"prosim!_ please! go on!\" _\"pravilno!\"_ or _\"eto vierno!_ ',\n 'that\\'s true! right!\" _\"do volno!_ enough!\" _\"doloi!_ down with him!\" ',\n '_\"posor!_ shame!\" and _\"teesche!_ silence! not so noisy!\" ',\n '                        popular organisations ',\n '1. _soviet._ the word _soviet_ means \"council.\" under the tsar the ',\n 'imperial council of state was called _gosudarstvennyi soviet._ since ',\n 'the revolution, however, the term _soviet_ has come to be associated ',\n 'with a certain type of parliament elected by members of working-class ',\n \"economic organisations-the soviet of workers', of soldiers', or of \",\n \"peasants' deputies. i have therefore limited the word to these \",\n 'bodies, and wherever else it occurs i have translated it \"council.\" ',\n '  besides the local _soviets,_ elected in every city, town and ',\n 'village of russia-and in large cities, also ward _(raionny) ',\n 'soviets_-there are also the _oblastne_ or _gubiernsky_ (district or ',\n 'provincial) _soviets,_ and the central executive committee of the ',\n 'all-russian _soviets_ in the capital, called from its initials ',\n '_tsay-ee-kah._ (see below, \"central committees\"). ',\n \"  almost everywhere the _soviets_ of workers' and of soldiers' \",\n 'deputies combined very soon after the march revolution. in special ',\n \"matters concerning their peculiar interests, however, the workers' \",\n \"and the soldiers' sections continued to meet separately. the \",\n \"_soviets_ of peasants' deputies did not join the other two until \",\n \"after the bolshevik _coup d'etat._ they, too, were organised like the \",\n 'workers and soldiers, with an executive committee of the all-russian ',\n \"peasants' _soviets_ in the capital. \",\n '  2. _trade unions._ although mostly industrial in form, the russian ',\n 'labour unions were still called trade unions, and at the time of the ',\n 'bolshevik revolution had from three to four million members. these ',\n 'unions were also organised in an all-russian body, a sort of russian ',\n 'federation of labour, which had its central executive committee in ',\n 'the capital. ',\n '  3. _factory-shop committees._ these were spontaneous organisations ',\n 'created in the factories by the workers in their attempt to control ',\n 'industry, taking advantage of the administrative break-down incident ',\n 'upon the revolution. their function was by revolutionary action to ',\n 'take over and run the factories. the _factory-shop committees_ also ',\n 'had their all-russian organisation, with a central committee at ',\n 'petrograd, which co-operated with the trade unions. ',\n '  4. _dumas._ the word _duma_ means roughly \"deliberative body.\" the ',\n 'old imperial duma, which persisted six months after the revolution, ',\n 'in a democratised form, died a natural death in september, 1917. the ',\n '_city duma_ referred to in this book was the reorganised municipal ',\n 'council, often called \"municipal self-government.\" it was elected by ',\n 'direct and secret ballot, and its only reason for failure to hold the ',\n 'masses during the bolshevik revolution was the general decline in ',\n 'influence of all purely _political_ representation in the fact of the ',\n 'growing power of organisations based on _economic_ groups. ',\n '  5. _zemstvos._ may be roughly translated \"county councils.\" under ',\n 'the tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very little ',\n 'administrative power, developed and controlled largely by ',\n 'intellectual liberals among the land-owning classes. their most ',\n 'important function was education and social service among the ',\n 'peasants. during the war the _zemstvos_ gradually took over the ',\n 'entire feeding and clothing of the russian army, as well as the ',\n 'buying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers generally ',\n 'corresponding to the work of the american y. m. c. a. at the front. ',\n 'after the march revolution the _zemstvos_ were democratized, with a ',\n 'view to making them the organs of local government in the rural ',\n 'districts. but like the _city dumas,_ they could not compete with the ',\n '_soviets._ ',\n \"  6. _cooperatives._ these were the workers' and peasants' consumers' \",\n 'cooperative societies, which had several million members all over ',\n 'russia before the revolution. founded by liberals and \"moderate\" ',\n 'socialists, the cooperative movement was not supported by the ',\n 'revolutionary socialist groups, because it was a substitute for the ',\n 'complete transference of means of production and distribution into ',\n 'the hands of the workers. after the march revolution the ',\n '_cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by populist ',\n 'socialists, mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries, and acted as a ',\n 'conservative political force until the bolshevik revolution. however, ',\n 'it was the _cooperatives_ which fed russia when the old structure of ',\n 'commerce and transportation collapsed. ',\n '  7. _army committees._ the _army committees_ were formed by the ',\n 'soldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the old ',\n 'regime officers. every company, regiment, brigade, division and corps ',\n 'had its committee, over all of which was elected the _army ',\n 'committee._ the _central army committee_ cooperated with the general ',\n 'staff. the administrative break-down in the army incident upon the ',\n 'revolution threw upon the shoulders of the _army committees_ most of ',\n \"the work of the quartermaster's department, and in some cases, even \",\n 'the command of troops. ',\n '  8. _fleet committees._ the corresponding organisations in the navy. ',\n '                        central committees ',\n 'in the spring and summer of 1917, all-russian conventions of every ',\n 'sort of organisation were held at petrograd. there were national ',\n \"congresses of workers', soldiers' and peasants' soviets, trade \",\n 'unions, factory-shop committees, army and fleet committees-besides ',\n 'every branch of the military and naval service, cooperatives, ',\n 'nationalities, etc. each of these conventions elected a central ',\n 'committee, or a central executive committee, to guard its particular ',\n 'interests at the seat of government. as the provisional government ',\n 'grew weaker, these central committees were forced to assume more and ',\n 'more administrative powers. ',\n '  the most important central committees mentioned in this book are: ',\n '  _union of unions._ during the revolution of 1905, professor ',\n 'miliukov and other liberals established unions of professional ',\n 'men-doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. these were united under one ',\n 'central organisation, the _union of unions._ in 1905 the _union of ',\n 'unions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, the ',\n '_union of unions_ opposed the bolshevik uprising, and united the ',\n 'government employees who went on strike against the authority of the ',\n 'soviets. ',\n '  _tsay-ee-kah._ all-russian central executive committee of the ',\n \"soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies. so called from the \",\n 'initials of its name. ',\n '  _tsentroflot._ \"centre-fleet\"-the central fleet committee. ',\n \"  _vikzhel._ all-russian central committee of the railway workers' \",\n 'union. so called from the initials of its name. ',\n '                        other organisations ',\n '_red guards._ the armed factory workers of russia. the _red guards_ ',\n 'were first formed during the revolution of 1905, and sprang into ',\n 'existence again in the days of march, 1917, when a force was needed ',\n 'to keep order in the city. at that time they were armed, and all ',\n 'efforts of the provisional government to disarm them were more or ',\n 'less unsuccessful. at every great crisis in the revolution the _red ',\n 'guards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, but ',\n 'full of revolutionary zeal. ',\n '  _white guards._ bourgeois volunteers, who emerged in the last ',\n 'stages of the revolution, to defend private property from the ',\n 'bolshevik attempt to abolish it. a great many of them were university ',\n 'students. ',\n '  _tekhintsi._ the so-called \"savage division\" in the army, made up ',\n 'of mohametan tribesmen from central asia, and personally devoted to ',\n 'general kornilov. the _tekhintsi_ were noted for their blind ',\n 'obedience and their savage cruelty in warfare. ',\n \"  _death battalions._ or _shock battalions._ the women's battalion is \",\n 'known to the world as the _death battalion,_ but there were many ',\n '_death battalions_ composed of men. these were formed in the summer ',\n 'of 1917 by kerensky, for the purpose of strengthening the discipline ',\n 'and combative fire of the army by heroic example. the _death ',\n 'battalions_ were composed mostly of intense young patriots. these ',\n 'came for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes. ',\n '  _union of officers._ an organisation formed among the reactionary ',\n 'officers in the army to combat politically the growing power of the ',\n 'army committees. ',\n '  _knights of st. george._ the cross of st. george was awarded for ',\n 'distinguished action in battle. its holder automatically became a ',\n '_\"knight of st. george.\"_ the predominant influence in the ',\n 'organisation was that of the supporters of the military idea. ',\n \"  _peasants' union._ in 1905, the _peasants' union_ was a \",\n \"revolutionary peasants' organisation. in 1917, however, it had become \",\n 'the political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to fight ',\n \"the growing power and revolutionary aims of the soviets of peasants' \",\n 'deputies. ',\n '                        chronology and spelling ',\n 'i have adopted in this book our calendar throughout, instead of the ',\n 'former russian calendar, which was thirteen days earlier. ',\n '  in the spelling of russian names and words, i have made no attempt ',\n 'to follow any scientific rules for transliteration, but have tried to ',\n 'give the spelling which would lead the english-speaking reader to the ',\n 'simplest approximation of their pronunciation. ',\n '                        sources ',\n 'much of the material in this book is from my own notes. i have also ',\n 'relied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of several hundred ',\n 'assorted russian newspapers, covering almost every day of the time ',\n 'described, of files of the english paper, the _russian daily news,_ ',\n 'and of the two french papers, _journal de russie_ and _entente._ but ',\n 'far more valuable than these is the _bulletin de la presse_ issued ',\n 'daily by the french information bureau in petrograd, which reports ',\n 'all important happenings, speeches and the comment of the russian ',\n 'press. of this i have an almost complete file from the spring of 1917 ',\n 'to the end of january, 1918. ',\n '  besides the foregoing, i have in my possession almost every ',\n 'proclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls of ',\n 'petrograd from the middle of september, 1917, to the end of january, ',\n '1918. also the official publication of all government decrees and ',\n 'orders, and the official government publication of the secret ',\n 'treaties and other documents discovered in the ministry of foreign ',\n 'affairs when the bolsheviki took it over. ',\n '                  ten days that shook the world ',\n '                              chapter i ',\n '                             background ',\n 'toward the end of september, 1917, an alien professor of sociology ',\n 'visiting russia came to see me in petrograd. he had been informed by ',\n 'business men and intellectuals that the revolution was slowing down. ',\n 'the professor wrote an article about it, and then travelled around ',\n 'the country, visiting factory towns and peasant communities-where, to ',\n 'his astonishment, the revolution seemed to be speeding up. among the ',\n 'wage-earners and the land-working people it was common to hear talk ',\n 'of \"all land to the peasants, all factories to the workers.\" if the ',\n 'professor had visited the front, he would have heard the whole army ',\n 'talking peace.... ',\n 'the professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; both ',\n 'observations were correct. the property-owning classes were becoming ',\n 'more conservative, the masses of the people more radical. ',\n 'there was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_ ',\n 'generally that the revolution had gone quite far enough, and lasted ',\n 'too long; that things should settle down. this sentiment was shared ',\n 'by the dominant \"moderate\" socialist groups, the _oborontsi_ (see ',\n 'app. i, sect. 1) mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries, who ',\n 'supported the provisional government of kerensky. ',\n 'on october 14th the official organ of the \"moderate\" socialists said: ',\n 'the drama of revolution has two acts; the destruction of the old ',\n 'régime and the creation of the new one. the first act has lasted long ',\n 'enough. now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it as ',\n 'rapidly as possible. as a great revolutionist put it, \"let us hasten, ',\n 'friends, to terminate the revolution. he who makes it last too long ',\n 'will not gather the fruits....\" ',\n 'among the worker, soldier and peasant masses, however, there was a ',\n 'stubborn feeling that the \"first act\" was not yet played out. on the ',\n 'front the army committees were always running foul of officers who ',\n 'could not get used to treating their men like human beings; in the ',\n 'rear the land committees elected by the peasants were being jailed ',\n 'for trying to carry out government regulations concerning the land; ',\n 'and the workmen (see app. i, sect. 2) in the factories were fighting ',\n 'black-lists and lockouts. nay, furthermore, returning political ',\n 'exiles were being excluded from the country as \"undesirable\" ',\n 'citizens; and in some cases, men who returned from abroad to their ',\n 'villages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary acts ',\n 'committed in 1905. ',\n 'to the multiform discontent of the people the \"moderate\" socialists ',\n 'had one answer: wait for the constituent assembly, which is to meet ',\n 'in december. but the masses were not satisfied with that. the ',\n 'constituent assembly was all well and good; but there were certain ',\n 'definite things for which the russian revolution had been made, and ',\n 'for which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark brotherhood ',\n 'grave on mars field, that must be achieved constituent assembly or no ',\n \"constituent assembly: peace, land, and workers' control of industry. \",\n 'the constituent assembly had been postponed and postponed-would ',\n 'probably be postponed again, until the people were calm ',\n 'enough-perhaps to modify their demands! at any rate, here were eight ',\n 'months of the revolution gone, and little enough to show for it.... ',\n 'meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simply ',\n 'deserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the great ',\n 'estates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... of course, as was ',\n 'natural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted all ',\n 'their influence against any democratic compromise.... ',\n 'the policy of the provisional government alternated between ',\n 'ineffective reforms and stern repressive measures. an edict from the ',\n \"socialist minister of labour ordered all the workers' committees \",\n 'henceforth to meet only after working hours. among the troops at the ',\n 'front, \"agitators\" of opposition political parties were arrested, ',\n 'radical newspapers closed down, and capital punishment applied-to ',\n 'revolutionary propagandists. attempts were made to disarm the red ',\n 'guard. cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces.... ',\n 'these measures were supported by the \"moderate\" socialists and their ',\n 'leaders in the ministry, who considered it necessary to cooperate ',\n 'with the propertied classes. the people rapidly deserted them, and ',\n \"went over to the bolsheviki, who stood for peace, land, and workers' \",\n 'control of industry, and a government of the working-class. in ',\n 'september, 1917, matters reached a crisis. against the overwhelming ',\n 'sentiment of the country, kerensky and the \"moderate\" socialists ',\n 'succeeded in establishing a government of coalition with the ',\n 'propertied classes; and as a result, the mensheviki and socialist ',\n 'revolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever. ',\n \"an article in _rabotchi put_ (workers' way) about the middle of \",\n 'october, entitled \"the socialist ministers,\" expressed the feeling of ',\n 'the masses of the people against the \"moderate\" socialists: ',\n 'here is a list of their services.(see app. i, sect. 3) ',\n 'tseretelli: disarmed the workmen with the assistance of general ',\n 'polovtsev, checkmated the revolutionary soldiers, and approved of ',\n 'capital punishment in the army. ',\n 'skobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of their ',\n 'profits, and finished-and finished by an attempt to dissolve the ',\n \"workers' committees in the shops and factories. \",\n 'avksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members of the ',\n \"land committees, and suppressed dozens of workers' and soldiers' \",\n 'newspapers. ',\n 'tchernov: signed the \"imperial\" manifest, ordering the dissolution of ',\n 'the finnish diet. ',\n 'savinkov: concluded an open alliance with general kornilov. if this ',\n 'saviour of the country was not able to betray petrograd, it was due ',\n 'to reasons over which he had no control. ',\n 'zarudny: with the sanction of alexinsky and kerensky, put some of the ',\n 'best workers of the revolution, soldiers and sailors, in prison. ',\n 'nikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the railway workers. ',\n 'kerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. the list of his ',\n 'services is too long.... ',\n 'a congress of delegates of the baltic fleet, at helsingfors, passed a ',\n 'resolution which began as follows: ',\n 'we demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the provisional ',\n 'government of the \"socialist,\" the political adventurer-kerensky, as ',\n 'one who is scandalising and ruining the great revolution, and with it ',\n 'the revolutionary masses, by his shameless political blackmail on ',\n 'behalf of the bourgeoisie.... ',\n 'the direct result of all this was the rise of the bolsheviki.... ',\n 'since march, 1917, when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers ',\n 'beating upon the tauride palace compelled the reluctant imperial duma ',\n 'to assume the supreme power in russia, it was the masses of the ',\n 'people, workers, soldiers and peasants, which forced every change in ',\n 'the course of the revolution. they hurled the miliukov ministry down; ',\n 'it was their soviet which proclaimed to the world the russian peace ',\n 'terms-\"no annexations, no indemnities, and the right of ',\n 'self-determination of peoples\"; and again, in july, it was the ',\n 'spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once more ',\n 'stormed the tauride palace, to demand that the soviets take over the ',\n 'government of russia. ',\n 'the bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at the ',\n 'head of the movement. as a result of the disastrous failure of the ',\n 'rising, public opinion turned against them, and their leaderless ',\n \"hordes slunk back into the viborg quarter, which is petrograd's _st. \",\n 'antoine._ then followed a savage hunt of the bolsheviki; hundreds ',\n 'were imprisoned, among them trotzky, madame kollontai and kameniev; ',\n 'lenin and zinoviev went into hiding, fugitives from justice; the ',\n 'bolshevik papers were suppressed. provocators and reactionaries ',\n 'raised the cry that the bolsheviki were german agents, until people ',\n 'all over the world believed it. ',\n 'but the provisional government found itself unable to substantiate ',\n 'its accusations; the documents proving pro-german conspiracy were ',\n 'discovered to be forgeries; [*] and one by one the bolsheviki were ',\n '[*part of the famous \"sisson documents\"] ',\n 'released from prison without trial, on nominal or no bail-until only ',\n 'six remained. the impotence and indecision of the ever-changing ',\n 'provisional government was an argument nobody could refute. the ',\n 'bolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses, \"all power ',\n 'to the soviets!\"-and they were not merely self-seeking, for at that ',\n 'time the majority of the soviets was \"moderate\" socialist, their ',\n 'bitter enemy. ',\n 'but more potent still, they took the crude, simple desires of the ',\n 'workers, soldiers and peasants, and from them built their immediate ',\n 'programme. and so, while the _oborontsi_ mensheviki and socialist ',\n 'revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the ',\n 'bourgeoisie, the bolsheviki rapidly captured the russian masses. in ',\n 'july they were hunted and despised; by september the metropolitan ',\n 'workmen, the sailors of the baltic fleet, and the soldiers, had been ',\n 'won almost entirely to their cause. the september municipal elections ',\n 'in the large cities (see app. i, sect. 4) were significant; only 18 ',\n 'per cent of the returns were menshevik and socialist revolutionary, ',\n 'against more than 70 per cent in june.... ',\n 'there remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the fact ',\n 'that the central executive committees of the soviets, the central ',\n 'army and fleet committees, [*] and the central committees of some of ',\n '[*see notes and explanations.] ',\n 'the unions-notably, the post and telegraph workers and the railway ',\n 'workers-opposed the bolsheviki with the utmost violence. these ',\n 'central committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer, ',\n 'or even before, when the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries had ',\n 'an enormous following; and they delayed or prevented any new ',\n 'elections. thus, according to the constitution of the soviets of ',\n \"workers' and soldiers' deputies, the all-russian congress _should \",\n 'have been called in september;_ but the _tsay-ee-kah_ [*] would not ',\n '[*see notes and explanations.] ',\n 'call the meeting, on the ground that the constituent assembly was ',\n 'only two months away, at which time, they hinted, the soviets would ',\n 'abdicate. meanwhile, one by one, the bolsheviki were winning in the ',\n 'local soviets all over the country, in the union branches and the ',\n \"ranks of the soldiers and sailors. the peasants' soviets remained \",\n 'still conservative, because in the sluggish rural districts political ',\n 'consciousness developed slowly, and the socialist revolutionary party ',\n 'had been for a generation the party which had agitated among the ',\n 'peasants.... but even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was ',\n 'forming. it showed itself clearly in october, when the left wing of ',\n 'the socialist revolutionaries split off, and formed a new political ',\n 'faction, the left socialist revolutionaries. ',\n 'at the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces of ',\n 'reaction were gaining confidence.(see app. i, sect. 5) at the ',\n 'troitsky farce theatre in petrograd, for example, a burlesque called ',\n '_sins of the tsar_ was interrupted by a group of monarchists, who ',\n 'threatened to lynch the actors for \"insulting the emperor.\" certain ',\n 'newspapers began to sigh for a \"russian napoleon.\" it was the usual ',\n 'thing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the soviets of ',\n \"workers' deputies (rabotchikh deputatov) as _sabatchikh_ \",\n \"deputatov-dogs' deputies. \",\n 'on october 15th i had a conversation with a great russian capitalist, ',\n 'stepan georgevitch lianozov, known as the \"russian rockefeller\"-a ',\n 'cadet by political faith. ',\n '\"revolution,\" he said, \"is a sickness. sooner or later the foreign ',\n 'powers must intervene here-as one would intervene to cure a sick ',\n 'child, and teach it how to walk. of course it would be more or less ',\n 'improper, but the nations must realise the danger of bolshevism in ',\n \"their own countries-such contagious ideas as 'proletarian \",\n \"dictatorship,' and 'world social revolution'... there is a chance that \",\n 'this intervention may not be necessary. transportation is ',\n 'demoralised, the factories are closing down, and the germans are ',\n 'advancing. starvation and defeat may bring the russian people to ',\n 'their senses....\" ',\n 'mr. lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, it ',\n 'would be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit the ',\n \"existence of the workers' shop committees, or to allow the workers \",\n 'any share in the management of industry. ',\n '\"as for the bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of two ',\n 'methods. the government can evacuate petrograd, then a state of siege ',\n 'declared, and the military commander of the district can deal with ',\n 'these gentlemen without legal formalities.... _or if, for example, the ',\n 'constituent assembly manifests any utopian tendencies, it can be ',\n 'dispersed by force of arms....\"_ ',\n 'winter was coming on-the terrible russian winter. i heard business ',\n 'men speak of it so: \"winter was always russia\\'s best friend. perhaps ',\n 'now it will rid us of revolution.\" on the freezing front miserable ',\n 'armies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. the railways ',\n 'were breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. the desperate ',\n 'masses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of the ',\n 'people, causing defeat on the front. riga had been surrendered just ',\n 'after general kornilov said publicly, \"must we pay with riga the ',\n 'price of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?\" [*] ',\n '[* see \"kornilov to brest-litvosk\" by john reed. boni and liveright ',\n 'n.y., 1919] ',\n 'to americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to ',\n 'such a pitch. but i have personally met officers on the northern ',\n 'front who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with the ',\n \"soldiers' committees. the secretary of the petrograd branch of the \",\n \"cadet party told me that the break-down of the country's economic \",\n 'life was part of a campaign to discredit the revolution. an allied ',\n 'diplomat, whose name i promised not to mention, confirmed this from ',\n 'his own knowledge. i know of certain coal-mines near kharkov which ',\n 'were fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories at ',\n 'moscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left, ',\n 'of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of crippling ',\n 'locomotives.... ',\n 'a large section of the propertied classes preferred the germans to ',\n \"the revolution-even to the provisional government-and didn't hesitate \",\n 'to say so. in the russian household where i lived, the subject of ',\n 'conversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming of ',\n 'the germans, bringing \"law and order.\"... one evening i spent at the ',\n 'house of a moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven people at ',\n 'the table whether they preferred \"wilhelm or the bolsheviki.\" the ',\n 'vote was ten to one for wilhelm... ',\n 'the speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation to ',\n 'pile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry or the ',\n 'corruption of government officials. foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded, ',\n 'or secretly sent out of the country to sweden. in the first four ',\n 'months of the revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies were ',\n 'almost openly looted from the great municipal warehouses of ',\n \"petrograd, until the two-years' provision of grain had fallen to less \",\n 'than enough to feed the city for one month.... according to the ',\n 'official report of the last minister of supplies in the provisional ',\n 'government, coffee was bought wholesale in vladivostok for two rubles ',\n 'a pound, and the consumer in petrograd paid thirteen. in all the ',\n 'stores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but only ',\n 'the rich could buy them. ',\n 'in a provincial town i knew a merchant family turned ',\n 'speculator_-maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the russians call it. the three ',\n 'sons had bribed their way out of military service. one gambled in ',\n 'foodstuffs. another sold illegal gold from the lena mines to ',\n 'mysterious parties in finland. the third owned a controlling interest ',\n 'in a chocolate factory, which supplied the local cooperative ',\n 'societies-on condition that the cooperatives furnished him everything ',\n 'he needed. and so, while the masses of the people got a quarter pound ',\n 'of black bread on their bread cards, he had an abundance of white ',\n 'bread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and butter.... yet when the soldiers at ',\n 'the front could no longer fight from cold, hunger and exhaustion, how ',\n 'indignantly did this family scream \"cowards!\"-how \"ashamed\" they were ',\n '\"to be russians\"... when finally the bolsheviki found and requisitioned ',\n 'vast hoarded stores of provisions, what \"robbers\" they were. ',\n 'beneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time dark forces, ',\n 'unchanged since the fall of nicholas the second, secret still and ',\n 'very active. the agents of the notorious _okhrana_ still functioned, ',\n 'for and against the tsar, for and against kerensky-whoever would ',\n 'pay.... in the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, such ',\n 'as the black hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction in ',\n 'some form or other. ',\n 'in this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous half-truths, one clear ',\n 'note sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of the bolsheviki, ',\n '\"all power to the soviets! all power to the direct representatives of ',\n 'millions on millions of common workers, soldiers, peasants. land, ',\n 'bread, an end to the senseless war, an end to secret diplomacy, ',\n 'speculation, treachery.... the revolution is in danger, and with it the ',\n 'cause of the people all over the world!\" ',\n 'the struggle between the proletariat and the middle class, between ',\n 'the soviets and the government, which had begun in the first march ',\n 'days, was about to culminate. having at one bound leaped from the ',\n 'middle ages into the twentieth century, russia showed the startled ',\n 'world two systems of revolution-the political and the social-in ',\n 'mortal combat. ',\n 'what a revelation of the vitality of the russian revolution, after ',\n 'all these months of starvation and disillusionment! the bourgeoisie ',\n 'should have better known its russia. not for a long time in russia ',\n 'will the \"sickness\" of revolution have run its course.... ',\n 'looking back, russia before the november insurrection seems of ',\n 'another age, almost incredibly conservative. so quickly did we adapt ',\n 'ourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as russian politics swung ',\n 'bodily to the left-until the cadets were outlawed as \"enemies of the ',\n 'people,\" kerensky became a \"counter-revolutionist,\" the \"middle\" ',\n 'socialist leaders, tseretelli, dan, lieber, gotz and avksentiev, were ',\n 'too reactionary for their following, and men like victor tchernov, ',\n 'and even maxim gorky, belonged to the right wing.... ',\n 'about the middle of december, 1917, a group of socialist ',\n 'revolutionary leaders paid a private visit to sir george buchanan, ',\n 'the british ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact that ',\n 'they had been there, because they were \"considered too far right.\" ',\n '\"and to think,\" said sir george. \"one year ago my government ',\n 'instructed me not to receive miliukov, because he was so dangerously ',\n 'left!\" ',\n 'september and october are the worst months of the russian ',\n 'year-especially the petrograd year. under dull grey skies, in the ',\n 'shortening days, the rain fell drenching, incessant. the mud ',\n 'underfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked everywhere by ',\n 'heavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete break-down ',\n 'of the municipal administration. bitter damp winds rushed in from the ',\n 'gulf of finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. at ',\n 'night, for motives of economy as well as fear of zeppelins, the ',\n 'street-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings and ',\n \"apartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o'clock until \",\n 'midnight, with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to be ',\n 'had. it was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning. ',\n 'robberies and housebreakings increased. in apartment houses the men ',\n 'took turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. this ',\n 'was under the provisional government. ',\n 'week by week food became scarcer. the daily allowance of bread fell ',\n 'from a pound and a half to a pound, then three quarters, half, and a ',\n 'quarter-pound. toward the end there was a week without any bread at ',\n 'all. sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month-if ',\n 'one could get it at all, which was seldom. a bar of chocolate or a ',\n 'pound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles-at ',\n 'least a dollar. there was milk for about half the babies in the city; ',\n 'most hotels and private houses never saw it for months. in the fruit ',\n 'season apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on ',\n 'the street-corner.... ',\n 'for milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in _queue_ ',\n 'long hours in the chill rain. coming home from an all-night meeting i ',\n 'have seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before dawn, mostly ',\n 'women, some with babies in their arms.... carlyle, in his _french ',\n 'revolution,_ has described the french people as distinguished above ',\n 'all others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ russia had ',\n 'accustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of nicholas ',\n 'the blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then continued ',\n 'intermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as the ',\n 'regular order of things. think of the poorly-clad people standing on ',\n 'the iron-white streets of petrograd whole days in the russian winter! ',\n 'i have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note of ',\n 'discontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculous ',\n 'goodnature of the russian crowd.... ',\n 'of course all the theatres were going every night, including sundays. ',\n 'karsavina appeared in a new ballet at the marinsky, all dance-loving ',\n 'russia coming to see her. shaliapin was singing. at the alexandrinsky ',\n 'they were reviving meyerhold\\'s production of tolstoy\\'s \"death of ivan ',\n 'the terrible\"; and at that performance i remember noticing a student ',\n 'of the imperial school of pages, in his dress uniform, who stood up ',\n 'correctly between the acts and faced the empty imperial box, with its ',\n 'eagles all erased.... the _krivoye zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous version ',\n 'of schnitzler\\'s \"reigen.\" ',\n 'although the hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuated ',\n 'to moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of paintings. hordes of the ',\n 'female _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on art, literature and ',\n 'the easy philosophies. it was a particularly active season for ',\n 'theosophists. and the salvation army, admitted to russia for the ',\n 'first time in history, plastered the walls with announcements of ',\n 'gospel meetings, which amused and astounded russian audiences.... ',\n 'as in all such times, the petty conventional life of the city went ',\n 'on, ignoring the revolution as much as possible. the poets made ',\n 'verses-but not about the revolution. the realistic painters painted ',\n 'scenes from mediæval russian history-anything but the revolution. ',\n 'young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learn ',\n 'french and cultivate their voices, and the gay young beautiful ',\n 'officers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and their ',\n 'elaborate caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. the ladies of ',\n 'the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon, ',\n 'carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, and ',\n 'half a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the tsar were back, ',\n 'or that the germans would come, or anything that would solve the ',\n 'servant problem.... the daughter of a friend of mine came home one ',\n 'afternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor had ',\n 'called her \"comrade!\" ',\n 'all around them great russia was in travail, bearing a new world. the ',\n 'servants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing, were ',\n 'getting independent. a pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles, ',\n 'and as wages averaged about thirty-five rubles a month the servants ',\n 'refused to stand in _queue_ and wear out their shoes. but more than ',\n 'that. in the new russia every man and woman could vote; there were ',\n 'working-class newspapers, saying new and startling things; there were ',\n 'the soviets; and there were the unions. the _izvoshtchiki_ ',\n '(cab-drivers) had a union; they were also represented in the ',\n 'petrograd soviet. the waiters and hotel servants were organised, and ',\n 'refused tips. on the walls of restaurants they put up signs which ',\n 'read, \"no tips taken here-\" or, \"just because a man has to make his ',\n 'living waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him a ',\n 'tip!\" ',\n 'at the front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers, ',\n 'and learned self-government through their committees. in the ',\n 'factories those unique russian organisations, the factory-shop ',\n 'committees, [*] gained experience and strength and a realisation of ',\n '[* see notes and explanations] ',\n 'their historical mission by combat with the old order. all russia was ',\n 'learning to read, and _reading-_politics, economics, history-because ',\n 'the people wanted to _know...._ in every city, in most towns, along the ',\n 'front, each political faction had its newspaper-sometimes several. ',\n 'hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands of ',\n 'organisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, the ',\n 'factories, the streets. the thirst for education, so long thwarted, ',\n 'burst with the revolution into a frenzy of expression. from smolny ',\n 'institute alone, the first six months, went out every day tons, ',\n 'car-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. russia ',\n 'absorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. and ',\n 'it was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the cheap ',\n 'fiction that corrupts-but social and economic theories, philosophy, ',\n 'the works of tolstoy, gogol, and gorky.... ',\n 'then the talk, beside which carlyle\\'s \"flood of french speech\" was a ',\n 'mere trickle. lectures, debates, speeches-in theatres, circuses, ',\n 'school-houses, clubs, soviet meeting-rooms, union headquarters, ',\n 'barracks.... meetings in the trenches at the front, in village squares, ',\n 'factories.... what a marvellous sight to see putilovsky zavod (the ',\n 'putilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to social ',\n 'democrats, socialist revolutionaries, anarchists, anybody, whatever ',\n 'they had to say, as long as they would talk! for months in petrograd, ',\n 'and all over russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. in ',\n 'railway trains, street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptu ',\n 'debate, everywhere.... ',\n 'and the all-russian conferences and congresses, drawing together the ',\n 'men of two continents-conventions of soviets, of cooperatives, ',\n 'zemstvos, [*] nationalities, priests, peasants, political parties; the ',\n '[* see notes and explanations] ',\n 'democratic conference, the moscow conference, the council of the ',\n 'russian republic. there were always three or four conventions going ',\n 'on in petrograd. at every meeting, attempts to limit the time of ',\n 'speakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought that ',\n 'was in him.... ',\n 'we came down to the front of the twelfth army, back of riga, where ',\n 'gaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; and ',\n 'when they saw us they started up, with their pinched faces and the ',\n 'flesh showing blue through their torn clothing, demanding eagerly, ',\n '\"did you bring anything to _read?\"_ ',\n 'what though the outward and visible signs of change were many, what ',\n 'though the statue of catharine the great before the alexandrinsky ',\n 'theatre bore a little red flag in its hand, and others-somewhat ',\n 'faded-floated from all public buildings; and the imperial monograms ',\n 'and eagles were either torn down or covered up; and in place of the ',\n ...]"
